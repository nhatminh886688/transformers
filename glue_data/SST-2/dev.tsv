very hitlerish of you idiot	0
now that supported statement disagree with much of it but it supportable depending on how trump statements are interpreted both rises to power were populist movements and there is an inherent type of danger unique to that type of rise to power but don see that type of thing becoming even remotely hitlerish here is the us don see him blaming immigrants for america problems but illegal immigration is very real problem and will continue to be substantial issue until we stop the flow regardless of what we ultimately decide as it relates to the future of presently illegal immigrants currently in the united states which will almost certainly be amnesty provided our legislators will include the repeatedly requested addition of moratorium of granting citizenship and or amending the constitution that permits these legitimized aliens suffrage rights for at least years and only then may they begin the naturalization process to become american citizens it worth considering that most of these folks despite being largely good human beings have no interest in becoming american and that significant problem as it relates to them benefiting from our social educational and health care infrastructure but mostly it destroying our culture our uniquely american culture and there nothing wrong with america having legitimate culture based on american ideas and values while trump certainly has his fair share of knuckle dragging bigoted supporters they re but small fraction of the overall the thing that most folks that aren fans of trump fail to understand is that our support of trump isn about him which is why he gets pass for saying stupid and at times yes inflammatory and insulting stuff this movement is looking at trump as catalyst to take back our political and economic system far more than any one or two term president can even hope to deliver we re all looking down the road to time where the global elite don control and limit the american people ability to pursue life liberty and happiness it has to start somewhere and anything but uninformed honestly suspect trump is going to shock everyone as soon as and assuming he doesn have it taken away by the political elite and their puppet masters he receives the nomination his tone his presence his carnival barking persona is all but certainly going to be reshaped into something far more presidential and more inclusive in terms of his language right now he rabble rousing not campaigning but look for that shift to occur once the nomination is wrapped up at least assuming it wrapped up the right way don understand why bernie sander supporters aren super pissed off at their primary system with the super delegates that give hillary false at least as it relates to the voters sense of dominance most people don even understand the super delegate issue and so when they started seeing hillary with that inflated by super delegate lead many bernie supporters fell off the radar seeing it as hopeless essentially killing the bern momentum before he even had chance to get started we on the right are now seeing how our party is no better as the elite is doing everything in their power to rob the people of their candidate and the thing is it will not happen without substantial uprising in this country against the elite we should all be disgusted with the state of our nation and our leaders	0

it cultural conditioning democide can only occur if population is sufficiently inured to guilt people often ask how could the third reich get away with what they did the answer is easy to find when you look at the culture of the weimar republic before the nazis came along the government was thoroughly corrupt much like ours the culture was very much anything goes and steeped in moral relativism much like ours so you have primordial solution ripe for gestating indifference to the suffering of those who don fit into preexisting vision of the future tm the powers that be in our world today also have vision of the future tm the us is unique in the world in that sizable portion of its population has no interest in the vision of the future tm and those that support the vision resent those that don hence their indifference and callousness towards them the next government to commit democide will very likely be our own	1

obama desire to disarm the american people belie his true intention he would go down the same road as all the other mass murderers in history have done he wants pliant population so that he can begin to cull the population of what he considers undesirables he would without second thought instigate reeducation camps which would then become concentration and finally death camps he has already started down this road with his illegal alien gambit he has unleashed fifth column of south american killers into our midst which have committed over murders of american citizens and he is concerned about this tragic event because it moves his plan for our people farther down that road murders attributed to illegals released by obama administration where is the compassion for the citizens killed by his illegal immigration policies much less the thousands of victims that are being brutalized by these thugs from ms- and other drug gangs that he allowed into our union who have committed rapes assaults robberies and other crimes this is href democide and all he can do is try and disarm the citizens from rogue regime that is at this very moment arming the worlds leader in terrorism with nuclear capability clearly the citizens need to take notice and stop this mad man before he sets the world afire and our nation to ruin by this age old and deadly game of tyranny in liberty	1
well hate to break it to you but he personally owns several riffles he does not go hunting by himself or out plinking but they are in his possession it is unreasonable to assume that person who is of subnormal intelligence does not have natural right of self defense taking that away from him can be death sentence having some government liberal suit determining if this guy is incapable of handling weapon from dc is ludicrous he is very safe about weapon handling and would remind other people around him about safety matter of fact he probably was more mindful then the majority of us normal people the other issue the bill of rights especially are natural rights but the do not give rights to the individual they shackle government from infringing on these natural rights of the citizen once you start down the path of making excuses that lump massive population into general category that would deny them their constitutional protection the logical outcome as shown by evidence of history has been the eradication of undesirables subhuman non-human labels that have allowed the democide of million people in the th century alone statistically speaking you have greater chance being killed by your own government then in all the wars globally in the th century you never answered the question either how does this executive order help chicago	1

liberals dumber than monkeys even monkeys understand that it takes female and male to make family sadly this common-sense awareness is beyond the abilities of liberals who want to ensure sexual perverts are praised and protected while normal people are persecuted for having common-sense but then again common-sense and education is the arch enemy of liberalism liberals prefer indoctrination to education and perversion to normality liberals are the people your mother should have warned you about democide remains the number one cause of death on earth and liberal governments are the main driving force behind that statistic consider how many people have died violently on our planet since the election of obama virtually the entire middle-east is caught up in war the russians are rebuilding the ussr and china is expanded its territorial control all due to the recognized weakness of obama his liberal fantasy perspectives and methods are destroying the lives of millions of people world-wide obama has more blood on his hands than any prior president in my lifetime the despots of the world know obama does not have the balls to pull the trigger or defend the usa or anyone for that matter they have never experienced such free reign to create war and terrorism before and they know their time for creating chaos will soon come to an end assuming the gop wins the presidency therefore expect will be devestating year for earth bloody year for innocent people world-wide not to mention the problems that caused our crash in have not been addressed we are still on the path to more government created bubble popping and huge financial losses and obama has created so many new regulations for small businesses like mine that for the first time in my lifetime more small businesses are going out of business than new businesses starting up they have created crony-capitalism and use it to say capitalism is the problem when the usa has very few industries where capitalism has not been replaced by grubermint crony-capitalism from agriculture to banking to insurance and health-care plus an ocean of government created crony-capitalist green jobs like those at solyndra the difference is capitalism creates wealth crony-capitalism consumes wealth capitalism raises all boats crony-capitalism sinks them	1

see no indication from history where full on ban of anything worked extremely well so disagree with you there didn work for alcohol didn work for drugs as long as guns are made on earth people will find way to get them if they become extremely difficult to get people will invent new weapon that works just as well the only reason they haven done so yet is because guns are readily available and are relatively inexpensive because of that and because law breakers break laws do not support any further regulations on the sale or manufacture of guns each step is just pointless infringement on the unalienable rights of law abiding citizens they don want to ban guns to protect innocent victims they want to ban guns to have free reign over the citizens all through history that has been been the result of gun bans and confiscation hitler walked into austria austrians had guns all of the sudden there were routine stories of children accidentally being killed by mishandling guns so austrians had to register their guns ultimately they had to turn them under harsh penalty for not doing so folks who deny the same thing could happen again have no basis in thinking that way we re talking years ago these things were happening how many millions and millions were killed in the th century from democide	1

saying don bet the farm on expecting all of them or even most of them to either get out of the way or join our hypothetical cause because history has shown that democide has happened enough times that does who relied on the goodwill of their own country military have ended up greasy smears on the floor what saying is if you re going to start an open revolt please prepare to have to fight them as well with special emphasis on eliminating their air superiority by eliminating their aircraft fixed and rotary wing quickly and their airfields or just anywhere they can safely land and refuel not happy about that prospect either given the amount of pro-us vets and active duty folks still in one of the services and the fact know quite few being an army brat with both parents having been in the army but let face it if obama appointed yes men heading the military were ordered to something clearly illegal quite few of the personnel would seemingly choose security in co-ruling in hell rather than having some balls and giving him the middle finger plus the media would absolutely smear any revolt and make them look worse than hadji so lot of our enlisted are probably going to think we re the clowns in need of noose just look at that story about that air force sergeant and his commanding lesbo officer	1

focused on that war because it was probably the deadliest bad analogy the muslim religion instructs muslims to kill and enslave and terrorize the christian religion is extremely different the church has not always been truly christian that led to the reformation for example the church has done many bad things in the name of christianity sometimes leading large numbers of people astray from true christianity there has however always been at least remnant of true christians sometimes persecuted by the church moving christianity forward false christianity in many american churches is contributing much to the decline in american christians people are not buying it fyi mao is responsible for an estimated to million deaths through starvation forced labour and executions ranking his tenure as the top incidence of democide in human history	1
the thirty years war was fought between and principally on the territory of today germany and involved most of the major european powers beginning as religious conflict between protestants and catholics in the holy roman empire it gradually developed into general war involving much of europe for reasons not necessarily related to religion as pointed out not everyone who claims to be christian is christian people who do not follow christ teachings are not christians anymore than person who claims to be jets fan and supports the giants fyi mao is responsible for an estimated to million deaths through starvation forced labour and executions ranking his tenure as the top incidence of democide in human history	1

the neo-feudalist agenda types have made two grave errors in europe as merkel recent actions show they have been emboldened by the success of the slow boiled frog approach to democide and have ramped the pace up to level where even the most stolid and browbeaten european populations are starting to wake up and protest owing to the repression of eastern europe during the cold war the power and influence of the visegrad group was not taken into account now these countries are successful economically viable democracies and they have strong nationalist voice if poland hungary slovakia bulgaria et al really dig their heels in they could derail the eu entirely it going to be photo finish with the forces of darkness but increasingly optimistic about our chances	1

death by unnatural causes some interesting facts death by mass shootings total death by automobile accidents year on average there has been to people year killed by automobiles since death by doctor malpractice the numbers in recent years have hovered somewhere between to cases of fatal medical errors although sources vary the federal government and some of the other reliable compilers of this kind of information tend to sidestep any controversy by lumping medical errors in with accidents when it comes to causes of death death by governments in the th century democide million these governments were hijacked financed and supported by private central bankers who are the real killers while mass shootings are heinous brutal crimes that pull on the heartstrings of americans the statistics prove that they pale in comparison to death by automobiles doctors and governments should we ban cars doctors and governments as well	1

again hold on to the constitution for if the american constitution should fail there will be anarchy throughout the world daniel webster let us hear of the dignity of man nature and the noble rank he holds among the works of god let it be known that liberties are not the grants of princes and parliaments john adams the right of self defense is the first law of nature this may be considered as the true palladium of liberty the right of self defense is the first law of nature in most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest limits possible wherever standing armies are kept up and the right of the people to keep and bear arms is under any color or pretext whatsoever prohibited liberty if not already annihilated is on the brink of destruction st george tucker the ultimate authority wherever the derivative may be found resides in the people alone james madison federalist no necessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves william pitt the right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been considered as the palladium of the liberties of republic since it offers strong moral check against the usurpation and arbitrary power of rulers and will generally even if these are successful in the first instance enable the people to resist and triumph over them joseph story if the representatives of the people betray their constituents there is then no resource left but in the exertion of that original right of self-defense which is paramount to all positive forms of government and which against the usurpations of the national rulers may be exerted with infinitely better prospect of success than against those of the rulers of an individual state in single state if the persons intrusted with supreme power become usurpers the different parcels subdivisions or districts of which it consists having no distinct government in each can take no regular measures for defense the citizens must rush tumultuously to arms without concert without system without resource except in their courage and despair alexander hamilton federalist no as civil rulers not having their duty to the people before them may attempt to tyrannize and as the military forces which must be occasionally raised to defend our country might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens the people are confirmed by the article in their right to keep and bear their private arms tench coxe the states between each other are sovereign and independent they are distinct and separate sovereignties except so far as they have parted with some of the attributes of sovereignty by the constitution they continue to be nations with all their rights and under all their national obligations and with all the rights of nations in every particular except in the surrender by each to the common purposes and objects of the union under the constitution the rights of each state when not so yielded up remain absolute if juror accepts as the law that which the judge states then that juror has accepted the exercise of absolute authority of government employee and has surrendered power and right that once was the citizen safeguard of liberty when you become entitled to exercise the right of voting for public officers let it be impressed on your mind that god commands you to choose for rulers just men who will rule in the fear of god the preservation of republican government depends on the faithful discharge of this duty if the citizens neglect their duty and place unprincipled men in office the government will soon be corrupted laws will be made not for the public good so much as for selfish or local purposes corrupt or incompetent men will be appointed to execute the laws the public revenues will be squandered on unworthy men and the rights of the citizens will be violated or disregarded if republican government fails to secure public prosperity and happiness it must be because the citizens neglect the divine commands and elect bad men to make and administer the laws the education of youth should be watched with the most scrupulous attention it is much easier to introduce and establish an effectual system than to correct by penal statutes the ill effects of bad system the education of youth lays the foundations on which both law and gospel rest for success the moral principles and precepts contained in the scriptures ought to form the basis of all our civil constitutions and laws all the miseries and evils which men suffer from vice crime ambition injustice oppression slavery and war proceed from their despising or neglecting the precepts contained in the bible noah webster preface to the american dictionary of the english

trifle with the injunctions of morality and recklessly destroy the political constitution which holds us together no man can tell how sudden catastrophe may overwhelm us that shall bury all our glory in profound obscurity daniel webster true law is right reason in agreement with nature it is of universal application unchanging and everlasting it summons to duty by its commands and averts from wrong-doing by its prohibitions and it does not lay its commands or prohibitions upon good men in vain although neither have any effect upon the wicked it is sin to try to alter this law nor is it allowable to attempt to repeal part of it and it is impossible to abolish it entirely we cannot be freed from its obligations by senate or people and we need not look outside ourselves for an expounder or interpreter of it and there will not be different laws at rome and at athens or different laws now and in the future but one eternal and unchangeable law will be valid for all nations and for all times and there will be one master and one rule that is god over us all for he is the author of this law its promulgator and its enforcing judge cicero and can liberties of nation be thought

conscience is incompatible with freedom-patrick henry to suppose that any form of government will secure liberty or happiness without any virtue in the people is chimerical idea- james madison the

direct mixture of religion civil government there is an evil which ought to be guarded agst in the indefinite accumulation of property from the capacity of holding it in perpetuity by ecclesiastical corporations the power of all corporations ought to be limited in this respect the growing wealth acquired by them never fails to be source of abuses warning on this subject is emphatically given in the example of the various charitable establishments in the management of which has been lately scrutinized- james madison our founders assumed the people assembled within their lawful sovereign state

in the same hands whether of one few or many and whether hereditary self-appointed or elective may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny james madison federalist no it may safely be received as an axiom in our political system that the state governments will in all possible contingencies afford complete security against invasions of the public liberty by the national authority james madison federalist no but constitution of government once changed from freedom can never be restored liberty once lost is lost forever when the people once surrender their share in the legislature and their right of defending the limitations upon the government and of resisting every encroachment upon them they can never regain it- john adams when plunder becomes way of life for

the key word is delegated read the law by bastiat some time he has one of the best description of what law should be ve read	0
no society can exist unless the laws are respected to certain degree the safest way to make laws respected is to make them respectable when law and morality contradict each other the citizen has the cruel alternative of either losing his moral sense or losing his respect for the law these two evils are of equal consequence and it would be difficult for person to choose between them the nature of law is to maintain justice this is so much the case that in the minds of the people law and justice are one and the same thing there is in all of us strong disposition to believe that anything lawful is also legitimate this belief is so widespread that many persons have erroneously held that things are just because law makes them so thus in order to make plunder appear just and sacred to many consciences it is only necessary for the law to decree and sanction it slavery restrictions and monopoly find defenders not only among those who profit from them but also among those who suffer from them fr ric bastiat the law	0

founders nature law nothing more nothing less and must be tried for murder treason doi the complete perversion of the law but unfortunately law by no means confines itself to its proper functions and when it has exceeded its proper functions it has not done so merely in some inconsequential and debatable matters the law has gone further than this it has acted in direct opposition to its own purpose the law has been used to destroy its own objective it has been applied to annihilating the justice that it was supposed to maintain to limiting and destroying rights which its real purpose was to respect the law has placed the collective force at the disposal of the unscrupulous who wish without risk to exploit the person liberty and property of others it has converted plunder into right in order to protect plunder and it has converted lawful defense into crime in order to punish lawful defense fr ric bastiat an unconstitutional act is not law it confers no rights it imposes no duties affords no protection it creates no office it is in legal contemplation as inoperative as though it had never been passed norton shelby county cas mr president it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope we are apt to shut our eyes against painful truth and listen to the song of the siren till she transforms us into beasts is this the part of wise men engaged in great and arduous struggle for liberty are we disposed to be of the number of those who having eyes see not and having ears hear not the things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation for my part whatever anguish of spirit it may cost am willing to know the whole truth to know the worst and to provide for it have but one lamp by which my feet are guided and that is the lamp of experience know of no way of judging of the future but by the past patrick henry march th amendment the enumeration in the constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people th amendment the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people if ever time should come when vain and aspiring men shall possess the highest seats in government our country will stand in need of its experienced patriots to prevent its ruin samuel adams hold on my friends to the constitution and to the republic for which it stands miracles do not cluster and what has happened once in years may not happen again hold on to the constitution for if the american constitution should fail there will be anarchy throughout the world daniel webster let us hear of the dignity of man nature and the noble rank he holds among the works of god let it be known that liberties are not the grants of princes and parliaments john adams the right of self defense is the first law of nature this may be considered as the true palladium of liberty the right of self defense is the first law of nature in most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest limits possible wherever standing armies are kept up and the right of the people to keep and bear arms is under any color or pretext whatsoever prohibited liberty if not already annihilated is on the brink of destruction st george tucker the ultimate authority wherever the derivative may be found resides in the people alone james madison federalist no necessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves william pitt the right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been considered as the palladium of the liberties of republic since it offers strong moral check against the usurpation and arbitrary power of rulers and will generally even if these are successful in the first instance enable the people to resist and triumph over them joseph story if the representatives of the people betray their constituents there is then no resource left but in the exertion of that original right of self-defense which is paramount to all positive forms of government and which against the usurpations of the national rulers may be exerted with infinitely better prospect of success than against those of the rulers of an individual state in single state if the persons intrusted with supreme power become usurpers the different parcels subdivisions or districts of which it consists having no distinct government in each can take no regular measures for defense the citizens must rush tumultuously to arms without concert without system without resource except in their courage and despair alexander hamilton federalist no as civil rulers not having their duty to the people before them may attempt to tyrannize and as the military forces which must be occasionally raised to defend our country might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens the people are confirmed by the article in their right to keep and bear their private arms tench coxe the states between each other are sovereign and independent they are distinct and separate sovereignties except so far as they have parted with some of the attributes of sovereignty by the constitution they continue to be nations with all their rights and under all their national obligations and with all the rights of nations in every particular except in the surrender by each to the common purposes and objects of the union under the constitution the rights of each state when not so yielded up remain absolute if juror accepts as the law that which the judge states then that juror has accepted the exercise of absolute authority of government employee and has surrendered power and right that once was the citizen safeguard of liberty when you become entitled to exercise the right of voting for public officers let it be impressed on your mind that god commands you to choose for rulers just men who will rule in the fear of god the preservation of republican government depends on the faithful discharge of this duty if the citizens neglect their duty and place unprincipled men in office the government will soon be corrupted laws will be made not for the public good so much as for selfish or local purposes corrupt or incompetent men will be appointed to execute the laws the public revenues will be squandered on unworthy men and the rights of the citizens will be violated or disregarded if republican government fails to secure public prosperity and happiness it must be because the citizens neglect the divine commands and elect bad men to make and administer the laws the education of youth should be watched with the most scrupulous attention it is much easier to introduce and establish an effectual system than to correct by penal statutes the ill effects of bad system the education of youth lays the foundations on which both law and gospel rest for success the moral principles and precepts contained in the scriptures ought to form the basis of all our civil constitutions and laws all the miseries and evils which men suffer from vice crime ambition injustice oppression slavery and war proceed from their despising or neglecting the precepts contained in the bible noah webster preface to the american dictionary of the english language in my view the christian religion is the most important and one of the first things in which all children under free government ought to be instructed no truth is more evident to my mind than that the christian religion must be the basis of any government intended to secure the rights and privileges of free people noah webster to james madison history of the united states to which is prefixed brief historical account of our english ancestors by noah webster ll there must be religion when that ligament is torn society is disjointed and its members perish the nation is exposed to foreign violence and domestic convulsion vicious rulers chosen by vicious people turn back the current of corruption to its source placed in situation where they can exercise authority for their own emolument they betray their trust they take bribes they sell statutes and decrees they sell honor and office they sell their conscience they sell their country but the most important of all lessons is the denunciation of ruin to every state that rejects the precepts of religion honorable gouverneur morris september those therefore who pay no regard to religion and sobriety in the persons whom they send to the legislature of any state are guilty of the greatest absurdity and will soon pay dear for their folly john witherspoon the works of john witherspoon containing essays sermons on volume liberty will not survive the total extinction of morals- samuel adams men may devise and adopt new forms of government they may amend old forms repair breaches and punish violators of the constitution but there is there can be no effectual remedy but obedience to the divine law noah webster--- we and our posterity reject religious instruction and authority violate the rules of eternal justice trifle with the injunctions of morality and recklessly destroy the political constitution which holds us together no man can tell how sudden catastrophe may overwhelm us that shall bury all our glory in profound obscurity daniel webster true law is right reason in agreement with nature it is of universal application unchanging and everlasting it summons to duty by its commands and averts from wrong-doing by its prohibitions and it does not lay its

this from the man that doesn know the difference between cost price and value the price charged for an item has more to do with the value than the cost but you keep using cost and price interchangeably and keep inisiting that price is directly tied to cost it isn the more value an item has the higher the price commanded regardless of the cost bastiat even said the cost of natural resources is zero it is only the value added to it that has value reading does not fix ignorance understanding does here is dollar go buy clue	0
also read what is seen and not seen by bastiat then read his other essays these are definitive works in economics much better than economics in one lesson then you ll truly understand	0

when plunder becomes way of life men create for themselves legal system that authorizes it and moral code that glorifies it frederic bastiat actually an immoral code if it is immoral to steal from someone how is it moral to authorize the government to steal from others for you	0
socialism is bad because it is immoral others can make this point better than can frederic bastiat said it best cited from here and here it is impossible to introduce into society greater change and greater evil than this the conversion of the law into an instrument of plunder but how is this legal plunder to be identified quite simply see if the law takes from some persons what belongs to them and gives it to other persons to whom it does not belong see if the law benefits one citizen at the expense of another by doing what the citizen himself cannot do without committing crime here bastiat points out how the law becomes inconsistent if done in group an act can be lawful if done by an individual it is suddenly crime in the end this amounts to nothing more than tyranny of the majority and compulsory servitude economist walter williams takes it step further can moral case be made for taking the rightful property of one american and giving it to another to whom it does not belong think not that why socialism is evil it uses evil means coercion to achieve what are seen as good ends helping people we might also note that an act that is inherently evil does not become moral simply because there majority consensus wish had said that tc mark	0

so far as they have parted with some of the attributes of sovereignty by the constitution they continue to be nations with all their rights and under all their national obligations and with all the rights of nations in every particular except in the surrender by each to the common purposes and objects of the union under the constitution the rights of each state when not so yielded up remain absolute if juror accepts as the law that which the judge states then that juror has accepted the exercise of absolute authority of government employee and has surrendered power and right that once was the citizen safeguard of liberty when you become entitled to exercise the right of voting for public officers let it be impressed on your mind that god commands you to choose for rulers just men who will rule in the fear of god the preservation of republican government depends on the faithful discharge of this duty if the citizens neglect their duty and place unprincipled men in office the government will soon be corrupted laws will be made not for the public good so much as for selfish or local purposes corrupt or incompetent men will be appointed to execute the laws the public revenues will be squandered on unworthy men and the rights of the citizens will be violated or disregarded if republican government fails to secure public prosperity and happiness it must be because the citizens neglect the divine commands and elect bad men to make and administer the laws the education of youth should be watched with the most scrupulous attention it is much easier to introduce and establish an effectual system than to correct by penal statutes the ill effects of bad system the education of youth lays the foundations on which both law and gospel rest for success the moral principles and precepts contained in the scriptures ought to form the basis of all our civil constitutions and laws all the miseries and evils which men suffer from vice crime ambition injustice oppression slavery and war proceed from their despising or neglecting the precepts contained in the bible noah webster preface to the american dictionary of the english language in my view the christian religion is the most important and one of the first things in which all children under free government ought to be instructed no truth is more evident to my mind than that the christian religion must be the basis of any government intended to secure the rights and privileges of free people noah webster to james madison history of the united states to which is prefixed brief historical account of our english ancestors by noah webster ll there must be religion when that ligament is torn society is disjointed and its members perish the nation is exposed to foreign violence and domestic convulsion vicious rulers chosen by vicious people turn back the current of corruption to its source placed in situation where they can exercise authority for their own emolument they betray their trust they take bribes they sell statutes and decrees they sell honor and office they sell their conscience they sell their country but the most important of all lessons is the denunciation of ruin to every state that rejects the precepts of religion honorable gouverneur morris september those therefore who pay no regard to religion and sobriety in the persons whom they send to the legislature of any state are guilty of the greatest absurdity and will soon pay dear for their folly john witherspoon the works of john witherspoon containing essays sermons on volume liberty will not survive the total extinction of morals- samuel adams men may devise and adopt new forms of government they may amend old forms repair breaches and punish violators of the constitution but there is there can be no effectual remedy but obedience to the divine law noah webster--- we and our posterity reject religious instruction and authority violate the rules of eternal justice trifle with the injunctions of morality and recklessly destroy the political constitution which holds us together no man can tell how sudden catastrophe may overwhelm us that shall bury all our glory in profound obscurity daniel webster true law is right reason in agreement with nature it is of universal application unchanging and everlasting it summons to duty by its commands and averts from wrong-doing by its prohibitions and it does not lay its commands or prohibitions upon good men in vain although neither have any effect upon the wicked it is sin to try to alter this law nor is it allowable to attempt to repeal part of it and it is impossible to abolish it entirely we cannot be freed from its obligations by senate or people and we need not look outside ourselves for an expounder or interpreter of it and there will not be different laws at rome and at athens or different laws now and in the future but one eternal and unchangeable law will be valid for all nations and for all times and there will be one master and one rule that is god over us all for he is the author of this law its promulgator and its enforcing judge cicero and can liberties of nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are of the gift of god thomas jefferson vitiated state of morals corrupted public conscience is incompatible with freedom-patrick henry to suppose that any form of government will secure liberty or happiness without any virtue in the people is chimerical idea- james madison the only foundation for useful education in republic is to be laid in religion without this there can be no virtue and without virtue there can be no liberty and liberty is the object and life of all republican governments- benjamin rush this information is non commercial for educational and entertainment purposes only	0

first off in that classroom you mentioned did you actually learn basic logic if you had you might realize that even if iran had developed nuclear weapons which all of the data and intelligence reports show iran hasn attempted since the why would that mean they are even remotely comparable to the ussr which developed primarily icbms meant to have long range delivery capability second why would you ever think that making iran an enemy of the world would be the smart option in deterring them from making bomb if you want to follow basic logic that would actually incentivize them to focus more attention on building one faster the way to make iran steer away of building bomb is exactly the opposite include them in the world economy allow them to trade with whichever countries they please as fr ric bastiat famously said when goods cross borders troops do not third iran is signatory to the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons which states that all states who have ratified the treaty and have been recognized as member states have the right to develop nuclear energy capabilities israel is one of the few states who has neither signed the treaty nor adheres to its tenets and has nuclear capabilities they are also recorded as having vague and shadowy nuclear programs fourth the radical parties in iran are in my opinion at least far less scary than the radical parties in israel who favor expansionism and very radical manifest destiny ideal thinking israel has some right to land that it has no claim on whatsoever finally you seem to forget that reagan didn always get what he wanted in treaty thus is the art of negotiation if america continues this quite dangerous policy of give me everything want or walk away can blame anyone but you who are so staunchly in favor of such absurd strategies when countries around the world say they despise us so	0

attributes of sovereignty by the constitution they continue to be nations with all their rights and under all their national obligations and with all the rights of nations in every particular except in the surrender by each to the common purposes and objects of the union under the constitution the rights of each state when not so yielded up remain absolute if juror accepts as the law that which the judge states then that juror has accepted the exercise of absolute authority of government employee and has surrendered power and right that once was the citizen safeguard of liberty when you become entitled to exercise the right of voting for public officers let it be impressed on your mind that god commands you to choose for rulers just men who will rule in the fear of god the preservation of republican government depends on the faithful discharge of this duty if the citizens neglect their duty and place unprincipled men in office the government will soon be corrupted laws will be made not for the public good so much as for selfish or local purposes corrupt or incompetent men will be appointed to execute the laws the public revenues will be squandered on unworthy men and the rights of the citizens will be violated or disregarded if republican government fails to secure public prosperity and happiness it must be because the citizens neglect the divine commands and elect bad men to make and administer the laws the education of youth should be watched with the most scrupulous attention it is much easier to introduce and establish an effectual system than to correct by penal statutes the ill effects of bad system the education of youth lays the foundations on which both law and gospel rest for success the moral principles and precepts contained in the scriptures ought to form the basis of all our civil constitutions and laws all the miseries and evils which men suffer from vice crime ambition injustice oppression slavery and war proceed from their despising or neglecting the precepts contained in the bible noah webster preface to the american dictionary of the english language in my view the christian religion is the most important and one of the first things in which all children under free government ought to be instructed no truth is more evident to my mind than that the christian religion must be the basis of any government intended to secure the rights and privileges of free people noah webster to james madison history of the united states to which is prefixed brief historical account of our english ancestors by noah webster ll there must be religion when that ligament is torn society is disjointed and its members perish the nation is exposed to foreign violence and domestic convulsion vicious rulers chosen by vicious people turn back the current of corruption to its source placed in situation where they can exercise authority for their own emolument they betray their trust they take bribes they sell statutes and decrees they sell honor and office they sell their conscience they sell their country but the most important of all lessons is the denunciation of ruin to every state that rejects the precepts of religion honorable gouverneur morris september those therefore who pay no regard to religion and sobriety in the persons whom they send to the legislature of any state are guilty of the greatest absurdity and will soon pay dear for their folly john witherspoon the works of john witherspoon containing essays sermons on volume liberty will not survive the total extinction of morals- samuel adams men may devise and adopt new forms of government they may amend old forms repair breaches and punish violators of the constitution but there is there can be no effectual remedy but obedience to the divine law noah webster--- we and our posterity reject religious instruction and authority violate the rules of eternal justice trifle with the injunctions of morality and recklessly destroy the political constitution which holds us together no man can tell how sudden catastrophe may overwhelm us that shall bury all our glory in profound obscurity daniel webster true law is right reason in agreement with nature it is of universal application unchanging and everlasting it summons to duty by its commands and averts from wrong-doing by its prohibitions and it does not lay its commands or prohibitions upon good men in vain although neither have any effect upon the wicked it is sin to try to alter this law nor is it allowable to attempt to repeal part of it and it is impossible to abolish it entirely we cannot be freed from its obligations by senate or people and we need not look outside ourselves for an expounder or interpreter of it and there will not be different laws at rome and at athens or different laws now and in the future but one eternal and unchangeable law will be valid for all nations and for all times and there will be one master and one rule that is god over us all for he is the author of this law its promulgator and its enforcing judge cicero and can liberties of nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are of the gift of god thomas jefferson vitiated state of morals corrupted public conscience is incompatible with freedom-patrick henry to suppose that any form of government will secure liberty or happiness without any virtue in the people is chimerical idea- james madison the only foundation for useful education in republic is to be laid in religion

allowable to attempt to repeal part of it and it is impossible to abolish it entirely we cannot be freed from its obligations by senate or people and we need not look outside ourselves for an expounder or interpreter of it and there will not be different laws at rome and at athens or different laws now and in the future but one eternal and unchangeable law will be valid for all nations and for all times and there will be one master and one rule that is god over us all for he is the author of this law its promulgator and its enforcing judge cicero and can liberties of nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are of the gift of god thomas jefferson vitiated state of morals corrupted public conscience is incompatible with freedom-patrick henry to suppose that any form of government will secure liberty or happiness without any virtue in the people is chimerical idea- james madison the only foundation for useful education in republic is to be laid in religion without this there can be no virtue and without virtue there can be no liberty and liberty is the object and life of all

started out this campaign truly on the fence between sanders and clinton clinton imo is the victim of years of unrelenting attacks from the right none has stuck but enough mud has been tossed at her to create doubt her record is actually pretty good liked sanders long before it was popular his idealism is refreshing but here ve always thought him big impractical br br ve now come down off the fence and for reason never have suspected bernie fans and lately bernie himself are acting like republicans one looks at trump army with horror the mindless devotion the racism and fascism on display make one recoil when look at bernie and his supporters seeing much the same thing mindless devotion check can do no wrong check try criticizing him as some have done over the ny daily news interview the fascism may not be there but the follow the bern creed certainly is br br in my email box today is warning that sanders devotees are pulling cruz they re supposedly out trying to pack state conventions to supplant delegates clinton won with sandersnista moles say it ain so if they re actually doing this what is the difference between the my way or the highway cruz crowd or trump nuremberg approach steal it any way you can off the fence it isn to feel the bern and that shame expected better of sanders and his followers not getting it	1
all this is true and stomach-turning and yet the democrat is barely ahead with lead that shrinking by the day br br wasn sandersnista during the primaries because didn believe he could deliver or even had clear idea how he might deliver on his exorbitant promises take sec clinton seriously as someone who thinks hard about policy questions and believes in public service and have enormous respect for her resilience and toughness br br and really really wish my party had nominated someone else sec clinton negatives are extraordinarily high her ethics really are--and long have been--a serious question and she defaulting to political caution that looks lot like cowardice by hiding from the press and spending her time exclusively with the donors br br trump clearly an odious embarrassment and it not like he gaining votes but her own support is eroding ultimately think she ll win after eviscerating him in the debates--assuming he even shows up but it infuriating that it even this close and have little hope she ll enjoy successful presidency	1
immature comment from sandersnista how shocking this is why there are multiple subs dedicated to laughing at you	1
the problem is since the infrastructure costs and wages are much lower in underdeveloped countries the now we re paying the bill pun intended clintonomic supply-side cure of the exporting trillions of treasury bills mostly to china we re still paying them interest on trillions and in exchange we imported cheaper cars clothing building materials you-name-it in the coffers of corporations like walmart etc br br so if an american can afford stock in these corporations and is forced to earn money by the physical labor of going to job each day that american worker and white-collar workers in cubicles also are s-o-l sure-out-of-luck in the global employment market br br now even the industrializing asian economy is experiencing the growing-pains of industrial capitalism that the experienced while the is experiencing post-industrial decompression br br apple for example could not make money selling expensive iphones made in the united states so an american laborer cannot profit from the technological-era economy only americans rich enough to buy stock in these successful american companies br br supply-side economics is an upside-down pyramid in the sand slowly tipping over into global economic gridlock br br as einstein put it world war iv will be fought with sticks and stones	1
puh-leeze maybe you ve heard different at some super-secret meetings for democratic leaning economists but the rest of us have at gt no lt time in the last year heard hillary utter anything other than the most very serious est deficit hawkery lots of talk about responsibility and nostalgia for the clintonomic miracles which were founded on solid balanced budgets don want those juicy fed bonds crowding out the innovative financial sector unduly afflicting those poor souls while they dream up the next rmbs libor-rigging or flash trading br br taken at her word she the truest last-believing neo-liberal on the planet she probably learned it from summers and delong and even they don believe it anymore delong emphatically so and summers infrastructure plan is larger than hers and trump combined br br we know the important thing was to save us from the alternative those uncivil bernie bros and their modern monetary theory economic advisers and you say hrc listens and understands but let hope you didn make the classic chump mistake of interpreting that though she understands she buys what you re saying	1

watergate was the story of my youth and putingate will eclipse it sadly trump and perhaps putin have miscalculated there are very few issues that can bring this divided electorate together but this is one of them br br bridge too far messrs trump and bannon indeed	1
if ever there was time for our electoral college to do the right thing it is now everywhere you turn in trump realm there are russian connections with appointments to the highest level in our government trump during the election requested the russians to hack hillary emails and bragged about it and now he tries to deny that his russian friends have anything to do with it the fact he is trying to discredit the cia using wmd is laughable considering he is going to appoint bolton to cabinet position john bolton was part of the wmd cabal trump is heavily invested in russia interest over america nato for example he and tillerson will lift sanctions on russia and the complicit republicans will fall in line to putin and trump wishes mitch mcconnell is traitor to the american people he obstructed the release of the cia report to the american people for his duplicity and keeping quiet his wife received cabinet appointment watergate was serious but putingate is dangerous trump cannot be allowed to take the presidency	1
can you say putingate in case your russian is little weak that p-u-t-i-n-g-a-t-e br br trump actually asks russia to hack and release clinton emails and now he has the temerity to say with no evidence that the intel is flawed there are simply too many links including the the paul manafort nonsense for the trump team to say that there is nothing going on br br question do you think trump would be calling for an investigation if russia hackers had favored hillary	1
quoting kristof never thought would see dispute between america intelligence community and murderous foreign dictator in which an american leader sided with the dictator br indeed but not just an american leader president-elect we are so far away from the pubescent arrogance and stupidity of watergate what kind of gate is this putingate	1
well there is some good news on the resistance front br this article about attorney generals tying con man donald up in court br sanctuary cities and if california moves forward with proposed legislation major sanctuary state br putingate br protests in the street br the market which is favoring growth in alternative energy and trade though that trade needs to benefit everyone not just the wealthy br international pressure from traditional allies including the canada and mexico and some asian states and from china which is none to pleased at the moment br br remember just percent of the american people actually voted for trump and he lost the popular election by about million votes it up to the remaining percent of americans to stop trump fascism in its tracks br br now after running the most divisive campaign ever con man don and his goon squad are blathering about how they want to bring people together br br have simple answer not my president	1
thank you for this but think we will discover it based on an assumption that will soon be proven untenable if not downright false the assumption is that trump flynn and their associates are not as unhinged as the pizzagate conspiracy theorists or tha mcconnell ryan or priebus have any guts br br trump has shown himself to be pathological liar and as such believes his latest fabrication just as he hopes we will believe it flynn if possible is nuttier whew birtherism didn come out of vacuum although perhaps vacuous mind br br no doubt there is cynical exploitative aspect to tacit approval of conspiracy theories and lies by the republicans they can demonize their political opponents and distract people from watching what really going on putingate anyone br br but cynicism and clinical paranoia are not necessarily mutually exclusive look at hitler	1
sooo what will history call this putingate pootygate vladdygate kremlingate we need to start pool	1
think trump has to hunker down and really prepare for these next two debates as he missed several opportunities to hit hillary during the first one understand the system is fixed with the activist moderators skewed initial and follow-up questions etc but he has to really map out how he is going to introduce and discuss topics such as benghazi the clinton foundation immigration private server issues and even bill infidelities if necessary figuring that the msm moderators won go there he wasn prepared for the first one and let her put him on the defensive with no real counterattacks know he tried to play the gentleman but we don need another romneyesque performance and fade away into the election	0
america patriots need to coalesce behind one candidate this election or all is lost as we cannot allow ourselves to splinter again and get stuck with another romneyesque candidate we need to unify like the progressives do they don care if their candidate belongs in prison like hillary they get behind them and trump is the only one of the bunch addressing the issues america is facing today illegal aliens islamofascists being imported to destroy us from within national debt that is bankrupting the nation gun control for law abiding citizens all the while as they give iran nuclear capability these are just couple of the serious problems we face today as nation patriots unite trump	0
you are out of your delusional mind if you think cruz would last two days in the democrat media schizt storm trump is thriving under as much as every conservative loves no charisma melon brain cruz fix news alone without the help of big brothers abc cbs nbc had cruz completely marginalized as doesn play well with others extremist loon stuck at nice guy romneyesque cruz will lose far worse than romney far less charisma and far lower likeability among superficial voters the low-i that elected obama twice cruz is in second only because he is viewed as the polite trump among the trump supporters not quite ready for trump because of fix news trumpbashing trump cruz	0
of course that pledge was written with donald in mind to help assure the gop that he would not color outside the lines expect jeb et al who encouraged it and readily signed it couldn conceive trump getting all the delegates he has won paul ryan refuses to endorse him so that he and those of his ilk can try to pull some stunt at the convention believe me they will not give up the washington way of doing things without vicious fight even if it gives the election to hillary jeb is looking like dishonest sadsack at this point it shame too because although he is not presidential material always thought of him as an honorable man and as for bill kristol and george will they re just upset because romneyesque candidate who hasn snowball chance isn in the running is trump wolf in sheep clothing time will tell but even if he is it inconceivable that he could be worse choice than hillary	0
jeb certainly does have substantial backbone and has not flip-flopped in romneyesque style in the things that jeb believes are good for america such as common core and amnesty that background will come in useful when he finally throws the tea partiers totally out of the gop after the next election	0
the clintons play by rules that favor the democrats and the gop has stupidly agreed to play by the same rules trump has his own rules as we saw when he reversed hillary attempt to play the gender card on him trump will destroy the clintons they simply don know how to handle him he proven immune to pc and he commands the media clinton is the most flawed disliked dem candidate in generations cruz would be too much of romneyesque gentlemen to take off the gloves and get bloody	0
no he just hasn figured out composed lawyer response cruz didn even respond to dickerson in the debate when he inappropriately attempted to school ted on the confirmation process of scotus very romneyesque	0
known solid thinking and speaking female vp one that is fully on board with the immigration and america first ideas but has some other spoken opinions of her own one that loyalty is obvious that is what is needed for the most important thing winning potus imho like to see someone outspoken almost as much but not quite as trump himself don want to see any romneyesque frightened to speakout media suck up types want direct and outspoken and unafraid from his vp too it doesn have to be female selection but it would be real boost for trump to have her shoulder to shoulder getting the anti msm anti elite message to the american people	0
yep walker is definitely romneyesque on immigration	0
that the gop which has spent the past years in utter hysterics over repealing obamacare doesn yet have an alternative plan to offer americans is astoundingly obscene it validates the suspicions that their agenda such as it is has nothing to do with actually solving problems for their constituents they ve been more interested in engaging in years-long temper tantrum that the president and the emerging america looks nothing like the romneyesque white-bread fantasy of yesteryear and has so often happens with screaming toddlers they ve gotten so angry that they ve forgotten why they re so angry in the first place br repeal obamacare br well what are you going to replace it with br obama sucks liberals are ruining our country repeal it br ad infinitum	0
gt but textualists use the text out of context to reinterpret law to support whatever ideological stance they ve already taken	0
yes scalia bent the constitution to fit the holding he wanted but think it horrifically unfair to use that one single example to brand all textualists as hypocrites	0
not saying we should jam the courts with endless cases because we need to be such textualists but the notion that prosecutor is generally just as likely to charge federal judge with dui with the same aggression as college kid living out of their van defies evidence	0
remember conservative judges are textualists they look at what the law or the constitution actually says and the constitution pretty unambiguously says that apportionment is handled by counting all free persons immigrants legal or otherwise are free persons because the only other two categories available in the text are indians who are untaxed and other persons meaning slaves that means that strict textualist like scalia or lol gorsuch would rule in favor of including illegal immigrants in the census because such persons are not slaves and not untaxed indians	0
regarding gun bans constitutionalists and textualists are for gun ban if you don agree with the founding fathers maybe take some time to figure out why	0
surprisingly there main ways to interpret the constitution either textually or as living document trump will nominated textualists whereas hillary most likely will pick justices that will read the constitution as living document with trump we are fucked with hillary we might be fucked the system was rigged against sanders but trump is not the solution	0
here the argument keep making to textualists at conservative	0
his entire article was about the th circuit reasoning behind the religious test and the incredibly unprecedented power that would give to the judiciary to become arbiters of intent while farting on the faces of any textualists who still have pulse as he points out previous precedents have explicitly said that policing campaign rhetoric to demonstrate prejudice once in office is inadmissable cannot be examined and would chill free debate- the same th circuit court even said	0
agreed and the fact that any judge has to do interpreting anyway kinda feels like self-described textualists would fall into hypocrisy at their very first case im not saying that the courts need to bow to the fast changing whims of the american people so to speak but that holding onto things because thats how it was written belies the historical thoughts from the founding fathers	0
what really bugs me like many things aboiut the hypocritical gop is there complete support for the invention of corporate personhood which spits in the eyes of those who penned our constitution so called originalists and textualists who act as though he constitution is constantly under attack and has been perverted meanwhile creating persons which jave more rights and protections than the natural person the country was founded to protect represent	0
don disagree in pragmatic sense but politicizing the scotus is tragedy imho we need judges who interpret the law as written textualists if you will this is the only fair way to interpret the legality of law when we diverge greatly in liberal or conservative republican interpretation we lose the robustness and consistency of the process and thus open it up more to be abused	0
to the extent that the right is composed of judicial textualists yes that is something to cheer about unless you re communist or something	0
that odd legislative intent isn supposed to be factor if the language of the statute is unambiguous at least for the conservative textualists	0
all leftists and democrats need to unite against textualists originalists or whatever other bullshit cover they use every single one of them is unqualified and unable to do the job fuck all the centrists or moderates who defend these pathetic excuses for judges	0
basically judges have lot of tools available at their disposal when it comes to interpreting words of specific laws however while am almost ridiculously liberal law school is weird because it definitely warps the way you read and understand judicial decisions in general most judges are textualists as elena kagan famously said we re all textualists and it silly to try to distinguish between liberal textualists and conservative textualists the difference is that in my humble opinion lot of judges either consciously or unconsciously allow their world view to shape their interpretation of text so plain meaning becomes plain meaning according to the judge experience beliefs there are particularly egregious examples of both liberal and conservative judges doing this and would count this gorsuch opinion as one of them he probably allowing his opinion to color what he thinks the obvious result should be imo the better approach is to enforce the obvious meaning of statute but if it ambiguous there are multiple different interpretive tools that judges can use in order to resolve that ambiguity which gorsuch didn do here the absurdity rule is one of them	0
so every one of these textualists who contributes to the development of the common law every time they apply or follow judicially created norms for statutory interpretation is somehow against the common law just because they still recognize statutory text as limit on their power that nuts	0
and that disagreement among textualists it question of how do you decide what the words in the statute mean when the statute itself is ambiguous enough so as to make things unclear	0
know that the above may be naive question but for all the textualists bring up and this likely does further echo what you said about scalia above texas vs johnson or better known as flag burning is protected speech	0
yes you correctly summarize how textualists see themselves in actual practice however any judge has to do some interpreting anyway since things are simply quite different now than they were when the constitution was drafted so they claim their method is the best but in reality it requires just as much re-interpreting as other methods	0
well textualist more common or originalist popularized by scalia is the word you were looking for there reason why gay marriage and abortion are particularly annoying for textualists there not text about them in the constitution the arguments are they are substantive due process rights	0
gt textualists are wrong to think that judges are practicing restraint when they search out the literal meaning of legal texts because there no literal meaning to be found textualists just as surely allow their ideological views to color their verdicts	0
textualists read the words and use their plain meaning at the time the words were used in the context of arms as written in the nd amen that would imply arms as in weapons utilized in that time period	0
for some strange reason conservatives are textualists with the whole constitution except when it comes to the nd amendment	0
because every judge respects stare decisis as broad principle even when they re overturning prior decision this is especially dangerous with so-called textualists who will frequently overturn cases based on well plain text reading so the prior decision was wrong so stare decisis doesn apply	0
well oddly enough the strict textualists right wing mostly judges would probably read it that he could be given the presidency through succession as the constitution only says he can be elected	0
textualists should argue that if they wanted to completely bar the person from office they should of used language like no person shall be considered eligible to hold the office of the president more than twice but instead chose on purpose to only bar them from being elected knowing full well the meaning and consequences of their words	0
there reason the aca went to the supreme court and there reason that roberts one of those textualists that you want to give credit for intentions agreed that it was constitutional	0
textualists aren necessarily conservatives both kagan and sotomayor are heavily influenced by textualism	0
the reason mention this is because the federalist papers tend to be one of the first resources scotus uses when debating topics like these and textualists like gorsuch tend to use madison word as law since he was the original architect of the constitution	0
don disagree some very noted textualists and originalists espoused and endorsed very progressive policies	0
and the irony is that if it came to scotus decision you would somehow see bunch of strict textualists suddenly read some intent of the constitution to allow naturalized at birth to be the same as natural born	0
gt in fact trump was the first candidate to name potential supreme court nominees in the february debate that took place on the night of justice antonin scalia passing on that day donald trump said we could have diane sykes or bill pryor perusal of these two potential nominees records reveals two conservative textualists who would make for excellent scalia replacements	0
gt the constitution prohibits any emoluments not just any gifts or quid-pro-quo aren republicans supposed to be textualists	0
textualists are explicitly not original intent ists	0
conservative media has dumbed down trump supporters by feeding them overly simplified policy positions under one penumbra globalists leftists or textualists	0
it only pointless if you expect some kind of respect to be shown to the effort the reason to reach across the aisle isn to look good but to mold what you want to see in opposition finding conservative justices that aren strict originalists or textualists might be hard but it could be well worth it as message that the backwards thinking stuff isn going to fly	0
that demonstrated that the so-called textualists are not textualists at all	0
lol they re the opposite of extremists they re textualists they typically make rulings within strict literal interpretation of the constitution th amendment is pretty explicit	0
for those wondering about the basis of the decision the four liberal justices and gorsuch found the law to be unconstitutionally wiki vagueness_doctrine say what you will about scalia and gorsuch who basically scalia-lite except he hates the chevron doctrine for some reason but hardcore textualists are usually pretty good about this void for vagueness thing	0
yup there is murky paradox on how originalists textualists treat precedents the correct answer is all precedents should be treated with the same validity as the constitution itself except when rulings were egregiously incorrect	0
ll be the first to admit though that in reality originalists textualists are guilty of using precedents la carte as kavenaugh said in his confirmation hearing precedent is not like cafeteria where can take this but not that he talks the talk and hope to see him walk the walk	0
this is exactly what the textualists strict constructionists constitutionalists originalists or whatever the fuck they re calling themselves now want	0
am just so happy can hardly contain myself kavanaugh is good man and the court will be majority conservative textualists for decades even though we will lose the house in november it is so nice that the court will be conservatives for many decades the house will swing back and forth many times and so will the senate and executive branch but the court will now be conservative for much of our lives and there is nothing anyone can do to stop it	0
the thing about textualists too is that they seem to only cling to an untouched document when progressive ideas are put forward they want religious criteria for office which madison and jefferson loathed they think that the govt can regulate industry article section disagrees and that the laws cannot change though there are means to amend and even throw out the constitution written within the document true texualism would also be appalled by mcconnell theft of obama sc pick	0
gt original intent cannot be reconciled against textualism most of those who are originalists in constitutional matters are also textualists in statutory matters and textualism rejects the value of the intentions of the legislature in passing text if one adopts originalism as an error-correcting lens which fits over textualism to account for the passage of time one cannot adopt an originalist theory which is incoherent with the underlying textualism	0
they ve never been originalists or textualists they ve always been conveniencists and opportunists it part of their core belief system starting with their christian faith	0
so you are saying that they are not textualists originalists they make decision based on their politics and come up with legal reasoning after the fact	0
originalism and textualism is pointless because even the words of the document are left purposefully ambiguous and turning to the original intent is useless because the framers disagreed when writing it the text is result of those compromises so any judicial theory involves some degree of judicial discretion and to fill in the blanks textualists simply impose their own beliefs on the interpretations at least the pragmatists and consequentialists have an eye on the impact of those rulings	0
actually trump has been inclined to choose justices that constrain federal executive power that consequence of choosing textualists and constitutionalists	0
how odd that textualists and originalists are virtually all hardcore conservative	0
the bullshit originalists textualists label is just way for conservatives to jerk themselves off about preserving the original intention of the constitution judges are literally required to interpret the constitution and all are susceptible to potentially changing the original meaning with modern ruling	0
gt interestingly enough the idea that the second amendment is an individual right and not group right is new even originalists like frankfurter and textualists like hugo black interpreted the second amendment as group right to form militias	0
your vote will be claimed as validation of their most egregious actions just look at how shs is arguing that the electoral college is empowered by our constitution to hand out free passes to rapists textualists my ass	0
gorsuch believes in originalism and textualism originalism is the view that the constitution should be interpreted based primarily on the thoughts of those that wrote it textualism is the view that federal statute should be interpreted without reference to the thoughts of those that wrote it judges that are both originalists and textualists tend to be conservative	0
enter scalia and gorsuch both of which ruled in favor of hobby lobby and struck down provision protecting the health of women because it was against someone elses religious beliefs this is exactly the type of encroach by religious institutions that madison and the other founders would have found abhorrent scalia and gorsuch are not textualists or originalists they are bullshit artists that aim to adjudicate their personal religious beliefs don let anyone excuse this attack on the constitution with fancy and meaningless judicial philosophies	0
agreed in fact even the most ardent textualists would agree for example that the right to bear arms does not include the right to possess biological or nuclear weaponry of course there are limits and present-day facts that the founders could not possibly have anticipated	0
that why think these scalia textualists or originalists are full of shit there is always ambiguity that leads to judicial discretion at least the realists are honest about the source of that rather than reading statutes like tea leaves which coincidentally almost always end up supporting those conservative justices political views	0
one thing that want to point out is that the original constitution wasn really about complete and total protection for all people imo the fourteenth amendment guaranteeing equal protection for all wasn ratified until brown board of ed was in so when these textualists go alllll the way back to the constitution origins they may be right that the founders didn exactly have all americans in mind amendments and decisions have been made beefing up universal protections for americans but the constitution was not some sort of perfect document at its origin	0
conservative judges would be more than willing to toss roe wade if they re originalists or textualists and most conservative judges are because they consider that ruling massive overreach of the federal judiciary and legislating from the bench rather than ruling on the exact word of the law	0
the young cynic in me wants to mock textualists as the new conservative pseudo-intellectual fad on the one hand that exactly what it is was taught from young age to ignore context which is exactly what textualists do	0
well again you run into the problem with strict textualists sitting on the benches of circuit courts the constitution specifically vests the president with broad executive powers although if we operate from scaila logic the president powers extend only to the extent they were enumerated in the constitution	0
much like christian conservatives they are textualists until it becomes inconvenient	0
putting gorsuch on the sc and lots of originalists textualists into the courts has also been great news keep scalia bright legacy alive	0
well yea but textualists use the text out of context to reinterpret law to support whatever ideological stance they ve already taken as opposed to consulting precedent circumstances and context as to the laws intent that was scalia mo all day long don know why anyone would expect gorsuch to act any differently	0
republicans don have activist judges by definition lol originalists and textualists don pull shit out of their ass to justify passing unpopular policy from the bench	0
it only the left who labels textualists judges as right-wing activists even though they are doing precisely what they should be doing if anything progressive judges are the ones who enforce law from the bench on no other basis besides that they like it	0
most conservative justices literally call themselves textualists or originalists	0
for group of people who complain about activist judges all the time you guys sure don seem to mind when your side is feverishly moving to confirm as many actual activist judges as possible regardless of whether they re even qualified so don believe you when you say it priority to have textualists on the court what you actually want is politicised judiciary that is actively undermining the impartial rule of law and doing the gop work	0
where are all the originalists textualists who claim to only believe in what the constitution actually says	0
not sure that this is the only reason that argument works for these people many conservatives are originalists and textualists with respect to interpreting the constitution now that has some really nasty implications when it gets applied to specific passages of the constitution see the following for an introduction to originalism and textualism and	0
really the most troubling aspect of all of this is how partisan it has become mean politics has always been part of this process but at least we tried to hide it now democrats are literally shrieking to block any scotus nomination why because they re mad that not how the courts are supposed to work and it everyone fault that we re here see before the rule was that of congress had to agree on the president pick for scotus before the nominee could be approved agreement would put the onus on the executive branch to find someone moderate enough and it would mean that congress would at least have to make show about trying to cooperate we want congress to get along because it bad news for everyone if one party just runs roughshod over the other after every election in the and there was notable increase in tensions for every scotus nomination we should be thinking about our supreme court justices in terms of whether or not they are textualists since their only job is to interpret the constitution but partisan politics has reduced it to nope don like your nominee because he too conservative liberal	0
want to stress that don think it should be this way it not healthy to have even the tiniest chance that someone might run for president to get out of legal jeopardy but our constitution is our constitution it doesn close the holes that it should in this case we are at the mercy of whether our scotus justices are textualists or not or failing that whether congress will do what it should and amend the constitution to fix it	0
cocaine mitch keeps claiming that these people are originalists and textualists wonder what founding fathers would think if their location information all the time was freely available to the british without any warrants any libertarian who voted for these people should rethink their choice of party because clearly these republican appointed so called textualists will side with the government over your privacy more often not	0
just because there is conservative scotus doesn mean the president magically gets new powers if trump tried to magic federal voter id requirement via executive order think the current court would overturn it and that would probably stay the same with any new justice trump isn helped by many conservative justices being textualists for those kind of questions	0
but if you spent any effort researching it you would quickly see that originalists textualists live up to their name	0
know how it was granted but if textualists originalists base their rulings on the text of the actual constitution--they must be against judicial review--because it is no where in the constitution and if it is no where in the constitution they must refuse to rule on whether or not law is constitutional	0
but there are some conservative racial nationalist legal scholars cranking out the legal arguments sadly scotus is now political body unless roberts takes steps to prove otherwise they will go along with the republican agenda we will see complacent court through the trump term and should democratic administration take over suddenly they will become textualists that stop at nothing to overturn legislative statute and executive orders	0
textualists originalist says that the constitution exists independent of their personal opinions but they read into the constitution when it suits them	0
you mean the travel ban who latest version gorsich just ensured was upheld yesterday the one where all five who voted in favor were conservative that example of hypocrisy was just made hypocritical by the man mitch mcconnell helped elbow into office with another rule that textualists like yourself should theoretically not favor	0
textualists deciding what the founding fathers believed is very similar to the way christians take jesus teachings it all seems to line up very conveniently with their shitty opinions	0
gt the difference between textualism and strict constructionism can be seen in statutory case my court decided last term the statute at issue provided for an increased jail term if during and in relation to drug trafficking crime the defendant uses firearm the defendant in this case had sought to purchase quantity of cocaine and what he had offered to give in exchange for the cocaine was an unloaded firearm which he showed to the drug-seller the court held regret to say that the defendant was subject to the increased penalty because he had used firearm during and in relation to drug trafficking crime the case was not even close dissented now cannot say whether my colleagues in the majority voted the way they did because they are strict-construction textualists or because they are not textualists at all but proper textualist which is to say my kind of textualist would surely have voted with me the phrase uses gun fairly connoted use of gun for what guns are normally used for that is as weapon	0
textualists sit on both sides of the aisle hugo black is one of the most liberal justice of all time and he was textualist antonin scalia is one of the most conservative and he was also textualist originalists however are bound to interpret rights as narrowly as possible	0
great example of this debate between the two can be seen in current debate over whether the civil rights act protects lgbt rights originalists say no america was clearly not trying to protect gay rights textualists say yes because by protecting against sex discrimination you cannot allow one sex to do something another can if man can marry woman woman must also be allowed to marry woman so on and so forth	0
trump order makes no mention of religion and courts do not consider statements surrounding the implementation of law or order to be material in the courtroom as elena kagan said we re all textualists now	0
legal theories are completely worthless textualists originalist and whatever the liberal judges call themselves all of them are worthless	0
so think of the original textualists being appointed to the court	0
gt if harlan was the great dissenter then perhaps scalia was the the unrelenting provoker by forcing his ideological adversaries to engage with his ideas both through his intellectual rigor and through personal charisma scalia reshaped and enriched legal discourse on the court in the legal academy and throughout the legal profession in turn he won the war even when he lost his hardest-fought battles as justice elena kagan once said of his approach to statutory interpretation we re all textualists now	0
yes that why said textualism is preferred however many textualists present their interpretation as the only correct one and miss that textualism itself allows for multiple interpretations albeit within smaller range than say purposivism hence the self-righteousness of people like scalia is not only irritating but often demonstrably incorrect	0
think all judges are textualists to an extent that the obvious starting point for every reading of legal text scalia made that joke lot one of his favorite opinions was written by john paul stevens due to its heavy textual analysis though the name of the case is escaping me suppose it going further than the text except in cases about the application of law that separates liberal textualist from conservative textualist if you want to draw that distinction	0
textualism is fine if it unambiguous and uniform but the people who claim to be textualists are full of shit or they would rule the draft as unconstitutional years ago as clear textual violation of the th amendment and same sex marriage bans as clear textual violation of the th amendment equal protection clause	0
if there were actual textualists on the ussc fine they re not which is why they cling to original intent which would also be fine but then they have to scrap the second amendment protection against state regulations since that requires incorporation doctrine which isn part of original intent	0
so sure welcome textualists if they re actually textualists and not just conservatives trying to find rationale for their prejudices	0
you re wrong to assume that want particular result actually don care that much about anti-gun laws personally it not deciding issue for me when vote anyway take issue with dc heller because when was reading it many years ago was incredibly bothered by scalia interpretive gymnastics so-called conservative textualists and originalists are full of crap when they interpret the second amendment they might hide behind the formalism of their interpretive method in other cases but the mask really slips here my beef is really with originalism textualism and the inability of certain judges to admit when they are dictating what they think should be there not with gun laws	0
textualism and originalism are related but not the same textualists think originalists are too nuanced and take cues from too many things like documents explaining the actual intent of the constitutional provisions and laws they are interpreting	0
for example straightforward reading of the equal protections clause should leave textualists scrambling to support gay marriage but somehow they never do	0
find this personally frustrating because my own political opinion aligns pretty closely to what the textualists claim to support which is why for example pro-choice but also consider roe wade terrible supreme court decision	0
you are thinking textualists or originalists the only people who call themselves constitutionalists are sovereign citizens who thankfully don think we have any of as judges	0
he is packing the courts but mostly with constitutional originalists and textualists and what trump is doing doesn hold up to those judicial philosophies the judges actually seen to have judicial integrity and aren just trump loyalists	0
they don believe justices should interpret the law and yet somehow money is speech it all sham textualists aren ruling in good faith	0
however the original founders didn want the supreme court as an equal branch the constitution says nothing about judicial review those two concepts were established decade after the timeframe that originalists and textualists consider valid for deciding on modern laws	0
think you are mischaracterizing quite bit there are originalists who don take into account new modern societal issues to interpret apply the constitution while others do no justice says fuck your to the constitution there are judges that basically ignore the advent of the internet when interpreting the constitution while others do some focus on the intent and pragmatism while others focus on the text textualists	0
scalia dead gorsuch not yet tested please explain how the th amendment could be so historically misunderstood by the judiciary or the apparent ambiguity of the nd amendment now how in the hell is textualists going to be any more correct in their opinions than someone who is trying to divine the constitutional intent	0
you re right it was thing but textualists are all about what formally and explicitly said love that speech by brennan he did great job explaining the classical understanding of interpretation before conservatives started donating money to law schools	0
he not textualist at all he revisionist feel this about most textualists anyway but kavanaugh takes the cake if you listened to his testimony on his decisions he would cite dissents as often if not more than prevailing opinion that not respecting precedent that called being an activist judge	0
textualists look to original intent if the meaning of the writing is unclear scalia did this countless times the constitution is set up in such way that if written portion becomes unclear over time the onus is on the legislature to make it clear the legislature can change the words anytime they want you are just upset that panel of lawyers can use the impossible process of determining several hundred year old words written by dead guys to get the policy you want congress is in charge of the words judiciary interprets and applies those words to complex cases	0
amy coney barrett joan larsen margaret ryan would by my female scotus picks off the top of my head there lot of quality judges out there whom support the constitution as it was written likely support other textualists as well that just me though	0
for conservatives they voted against any restrictions on campaign finance holding that money is speech yet they will state they are textualists and follow the test of the constitution but money was not mention as speech rather speech is speech and didn include expressions then conservative judges will turn around and hold that an employer can force workers to pay into unions despite opting out of union protections so there are no limits on spending don touch someone money in one case and the other is well force the worker to pay in these ideals are conflicting	0
no he not he said he would appoint people approved by the heritage foundation--which is headed by former sen and tea party darling jim demint and trump was the first to actually name examples of people he would appoint to replace scalia william pryor jr and diane sykes perusal of these two potential nominees records reveals two conservative textualists who would make for excellent scalia replacements and maybe be even more conservative than scalia	0
ironically if you re going to follow this observation by saying yeah but there no way his ideology outside of the court doesn pollute his ideology inside it then you be falling into the same dangerous trap that he and other like-minded textualists have been warning about for decades	0
the constitution prohibits any emoluments not just any gifts or quid-pro-quo aren republicans supposed to be textualists	0
let be real the court sort of made up the right to privacy as it has to be incredibly inferred as woman love what roe did but it was very much judicial activism and can easily be argued away if you have enough originalists and textualists on the bench	0
what are you talking about you understand that the results of the opinion do not matter justices are not supposed to make laws they are supposed to interpret them conservative justices tend to be textualists better and in my opinion the correct method of interpretation are our arguing against textualism or the results that textualism led too in various opinions if it the results then examine why the judge read the law to lead to such result the law needs to be changed not the judge we have checks and balances for reason courts should not be legislating from the bench your failure to understand the complexities of our judicial and legislative systems by simply reducing it to hurr durr sure republican judges are religious nut jobs that hate gays is stupid and dangerous have you read any of scalia opinions in full	0
well first of all it ridiculous to try to interpret the founder intent since there were so many founders with so many different views they hardly all agreed on anything for any quote you can come up with from founding father supporting one viewpoint there another quote from another founding father supporting the opposite viewpoint scalia himself one of the strictest textual readers out there laid out how stupid an idea that is there are no justice that look at the founder intent instead the strict textualists look at the original meaning of the constitution what the words and phrases meant at the time it was signed that was after all what was agreed upon	0
also like textualists as well	0
haven ever seen true textualist have seen many people purport to be textualists but have never seen an actual one highly doubt kavanaugh would permit government wiretapping without warrant even though such thing is permitted by the literal reading of the th amendment has been constantly infringed upon where now it essentially just means semi-automatic small arms and while there is still some argument about whether that is an infringement too far none of the justices including kavanaugh would ever loosen regulation to the point that random citizen could freely own and operate fully functional tanks or an air force or other medium to heavy armaments up to nukes which have bit more complicated legal stuff don wanna get into even though textualist interpretation should support that loosening every textualist bends what it means to be textualist to suit their agenda eventually even if the agenda is the practical functioning of the united states because quite simply the united states can not function in the modern day with genuine true textualism interpretation of the constitution	0
neither thomas or gorsuch are originalists they are textualists that actually quite different in fact even scalia who many people consider an originalist even though once again he was textualist thought that originalism was bullshit don credit this view to something that isn there	0
fucking so called textualists and originalists side with government collecting your location data without warrant how can anybody who claim to be an originalist believe that the founding fathers would be ok with british government having their location data all the time shithead libertarians who voted for trump should have look at this and see who gorsuch sided with	0
textualists	0
textualists	0
replacing scalia with gorsuch did not in many minds change the composition of the court replacing kennedy with somebody further to the right gives you bunch of textualists on the supreme court instead of bunch of statists	0
judicial philosophy is important in whether the constitution is read conservatively or liberally some conservatives along with originalists take issue with the use of the commerce clause for the basis of the government power to regulate as much as it does even the civil rights act hinges on the commerce clause originalists or textualists are also more likely to read the second amendment as an unequivocal individual right to bear arms	0
most important is that he has evolved his opinions meaning he can be swayed unlike the strict textualists on the court	0
sorry while agree that it should it does not currently include cyber warfare especially with textualists originalists interpreting the constitution war within this context means an armed conflict that is declared war by congress the last time that was done was wwii	0
the gop pretends to be textualists and whine that decisions like roe wade are wrong because the constitution doesn discuss abortion or even right to privacy why then should gop potus be barred from prosecution when the constitution is completely silent about it and where doing so would possibly immunize the potus from prosecution forever if the statute of limitations runs before he is out of office	0
the only people it makes super legislators are the living tree type who want to tweak and rewrite the constitution to fit their world view all supreme court judges should be textualists imho then what would they have to change legislate	0
believe you can be an originalists and especially textualist and still honor precedents the prior rulings are settled law and the damage is already done to the constitution integrity the originalist textualists goal is to keep it from happening any further	0
to me that pretty much means we need more than textualists bigotry and privilege often interferes with one understanding of the spirit of why the law was written the dissenting opinions filed in obergefell hodges bigotry and the majority opinion filed in ledbetter goodyear privilege are great examples of how bigotry and privilege are often packaged as being faithful to the constitution	0
and people like clarence thomas and gorsuch are much worse than that and they ll be the one calling the constitutional shots they will conclude in so many words that they don approve of trump behavior but as textualists with motivated biases they will insist that such thing be handled by an unrepresentative legislature that they helped stack in the first place	0
the scotus has become politicized clarence thomas wife is conservative political activist yet he has never recused himself from any case dealing with his wife activism gorsuch and alito are originalists and textualists which is fancy way of saying that they re reinterpreting the constitution to mean whatever they want it to mean instead of relying on precedent and jurisprudence it very similar to how wahhabi muslims throw out centuries of quaranic scholarship in favor of hard-line kill-all-the-infidels interpretations	0
agree re scalia he was textualists and consistently read the constitution very strictly which was hugely favorable in criminal procedure cases roberts is pretty similar in that he also shows tendency towards consistency not just blindly following party lines	0
mean half of them are liberals and the other half textualists	0
interestingly enough the idea that the second amendment is an individual right and not group right is new even originalists like frankfurter and textualists like hugo black interpreted the second amendment as group right to form militias this view was expressed in united states cruikshank and other cases which remained the law of the land for over century it wasn until the nra became powerful that people and scholars began seeing it differently the rehnquist court and roberts court were the first where that ever became majority opinion	0
it also worth pointing out that the arguments for all the cases have pointed out where acutely unsound in the eye of the law mainly roe wade conservative justices for the vast majority of the time are strict textualists when it comes to the law so the handful of times they did step outside the norm were for very important cases guess my point is they went against the grain with these decisions and these regressive laws would still be in effect if they had adhered to their strict reading	0
while can agree with the sentiment that supreme court justices are not of the political variety but as you said are they originalists intentionalists living constitutionalists or textualists my fear is that as the partisan divide in the nation increases so does the potential for future supreme court appointments some people are saying that they want trump to nominate ted cruz tell me that wouldnt be political appointment it would be disgusting	0
ironic scalia was one of the few textualists left justices basing decisions on their personal opinions is the realm of the living constitutionalists	0
agreed it totally baffling to me how many otherwise liberal people become lousy textualists when it suits them not that conservatives are immune but the echo chamber is is louder on the other side right now for obvious reasons	0
you re looking at the court far too much along party lines it not as easy as liberal or conservative when it comes to the scotus it more due to how they interpret the constitution are they originalists intentionalists living constitutionalists or textualists of those living constitutionalists are most open to compromise interpreting the constitution in light of its text purposes and our whole experience according to breyer it not flipping sides because that not how they re deciding cases they re interpreting and applying the constitution	0
now the conservative members of the court tend to be originalists or textualists like scalia who has been called both and tend to be the least likely to compromise because they believe that the meaning of the constitution does not change or evolve over time the text is both fixed and knowable and that fixed meaning of the text should be the sole guide in their application or interpretation	0
they love the constitution until it conflicts with their biases and before someone gives me the hurr durr both parties are the same bullshit it your party that is full of textualists	0
everyone even the textualists agree with this idea to some extent they just limit it much more than the more liberal judges the problem that many on the left have with textualism is that it leaves normal people vulnerable to laws like this all the trucker knew is that the law says he doesn have to do unsafe work he didn know the nitty gritty text that technically excluded this situation	0
think you need to be careful with how you describe constructionalists it seems like you are talking about textualists what is the literal meaning of the words of the law whereas the courts conservatives are better described as originalists what did the law mean when it was made there is an important difference and even scalia harshly criticized strict textualism while he thought textualism was useful tool which it is scalia worried about it being taken too far which it can be	0
look legal experts disagree on this topic there long standing debate between textualists originalists and living constitutionalists am firmly in the former camp so when it comes to the law adapting to new trends that largely matter of opinion not fact	0
but as elena kagan has said scalia influence was so great that we re all textualists now so as each day passes there is less and less support for your view	0
who decides what an undue burden is you and can both have different opinions as to what would be an undue burden to woman seeking an abortion the same can be said of conservative justice and liberal justice they can both be textualists and have different takeaways from undue burden	0
textualists like gorsich and scalia don interpret the constitution they read it as it was written including the amendments which may be added at any time by congress leftists like sotomayer and ginsburg use it as sock puppet the so called living constitution and they are partisan to the core look at the recent travel ban dissenting opinion sotomayer said that based on candidate trumps campaign statements not anything mentioned in the actual executive order trumps travel ban was unconstitutional despite the fact that the president absolutely has authority to restrict travel as carter reagan bush clinton bush and obama did certain the ww presidents did too but only know back to carter the same leftist justices said obamacare was constitutional on the grounds that the individual mandate was tax despite president obama himself in saying that the individual mandate was not tax they are partisan hypocrites and that why will always support textualists hopefully we get more like kennedy	0
honestly as much as would like the law regarding abortion to be changed don see gorsuch or even kavanaugh changing it based on how both have acted prior to their nomination and how gorsuch has ruled on cases since his appointment constitutional textualists like gorsuch and kavanaugh strongly vote in line with precedent	0
don think it insane to think that there are academics who are also very strict textualists they probably don think it good idea but it not like the constitution makes an exception for self-pardons	0
ll edit my post above think all three of the top choices are strong candidates all three will be strong on the first amendment and are originalist and textualists	0
ll have to concede that he will only have done good things depending on your political philosophy the only thing ever wanted out of trump presidency was denying hillary supreme court pick he did that everything else is up for discussion suppose should say that conservative but not republican and view having strict constructionalists textualists on the supreme court as good thing because the constitution can be changed by the processes outlined therein but it should only be changed by those processes dislike interpreting the constitution it written in english it needs no interpretation it might however need amending and fine with that so long as the process is followed as intended hillary would never have appointed someone inline with my personal views on the matter so for me trump did good here	0
gt textualists	0
edit think all three of the top choices are strong candidates all three will be strong on the first amendment and are originalist and textualists	0
think clearer way to state your issue with textualists originalists is that they are unbound by precedent and the methodology is inherently judicially activist	0
one of the only other places in the constitution that contains well-interpreted prefatory clause is art section more commonly known as the progress clause here the prefatory clause is treated entirely differently that is to say the conservative textualists on the scotus do whatever the fuck they want in order to support their agenda	0
middle schooler is taught the th amendment and the supreme court isn gonna be getting close to that roberts may be conservative but he ruled against the conservative status quo on lgbt rights thomas and gorsuch are strict textualists and the text of the th amendment is pretty darned clear	0
now of course we ve got an shameless anti-democratic opportunists running the legislative branch exploiting every loophole and suppressing votes we ve got judicial branch dominated by originalists and textualists eager to overturn decades if not centuries of precedence with their exceedingly narrow and archaic interpretations of the authors intent and language and we ve got an executive branch run by an utterly unscrupulous and incompetent fraud which the other two branches are willing to hand basically all authority to also press that is partly tame and partly craven and bureaucracy that is being gutted and compromised	0
concerning activist judges this is simply term that used to describe rulings one doesn like whereas ruling one likes are proper interpretations of the constitution this is bogus and intellectually dishonest the real story is both more frustrating for people like you and me and also more interesting the constitution can be used to frame multiple often contradictory arguments there is plenty that almost all scholars and judges agree on like constitutional protections for noncitizens but then there are some who think everything needs to be interpreted literally textualists originalists and some who think the constitution should be interpreted in modern context living constitution which can lead to vastly different interpretations of in very specific cases	0
we don prosecute every asshole who stuffs ballot boxes for treason much like we don prosecute people who publish fictional novels on the internet for wire fraud our laws are informed by history and context regardless of whatever new disingenuous arguments the textualists come up with next we as society have agreed for long time that the punishment should fit the crime it even part of our bill of rights	0
was on the other side for long time textualists and constitutionalists on the courts are more likely to be stronger checks on federal power	0
well of the justices are bought and paid for extensions of the republican junta so it not likely you are going to get any support from them in protecting voting rights since voting isn an explicit right and those twatwaffles are all textualists	0
liberals pick liberal jurists but conservatives pick originalists textualists and pragmatists most of the time those legal theories align with conservativism but sometimes they don thats not necessarily the jurists being moderates on some left right scale but the liberals are consistently liberal even if when liberalism is inconsistent ie when they go from free speech advocates to calling speech weapon in need of tighter regulation	0
that always bothered me about those originalists textualists whatever the fuck they re calling themselves today their entire judicial philosophy is not internally consistent	0
textualists shouldn ignore individuals and individual states ability to regulate the class of laws outside of the constitution but this only seems to apply to states ability to restrict the rights of individuals not expand them for example scalia ruling in gonzales raich commerce clause	0
the best and most impactful example of how we are affected by the activism of textualists ignoring prescedent citizens united	0
the framers never stated that money equals speach yet here we are under citizens united because the origionalists and textualists made wild interpretation that cast down decades of progress to mitigate the impact of money in politics	0
you are saying that conservatives are textualists originalists except for when they aren but that ok when you agree with them that is mental gymnastics	0
funny originalists textualists and pseudo-intellectuals aka libertarians should be all about enforcing the emoluments clause why dey no like da constitution when it bad for dem	0
no think they are very happy with the constitution for the most part which is why they want textualists the constitution is right wing document	0
the founding fathers set up the three branches to check each other power now that the majority on the supreme court is conservative there is fear they will act like congress has acted spearheaded by mcconnell and the weaponizing of politics for the past years completely shielding the president at every turn in an unprecedented manner just to retain political power congress is supposed to be check on the president and the judiciary given the current media environment if someone talks out against trump and what he wants their political careers are largely over if they are republican similarly there has been an air over the court of impartiality and partisanship since the conservative supreme court decision to stop the recount which give the presidency to bush despite nothing in the constitution giving textualists the grounds to deny recount	0
that not that persons claim at least as read it believe they are signaling an interest in how textualists will view this issue whose political beliefs generally not always tend to align with the gop conservative views counting only citizens but whose constitutional interpretation philosophy should dictate counting everyone free persons	0
textualists are now considered activists huh til	0
you re blaming the judiciary for our laws being archaic and contradictory that is the legislature fault obviously there will be differences in how you interpret the law but that the thing its differences in how you interpret the law not how the law should be its nuanced difference but its important you re going to have textualists like gorsuch and scalia who are both conservatives but there is nothing that says you can use textualist approach to argue for liberal laws in court	0
they re only textualists in that they look for words to support the radical conservative policy outcomes inherent in their decisions they ignore inconvenient words there no way you can square off ignoring the first clause of the second amendment well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of free state with being textualist and still find the second amendment allows the unfettered right to bear arms without universal background checks the militia in this country is neither regulated nor necessary to the security of the state when we spend trillion in defense annually so instead the justices decide they re no longer textualists they re originalists looking at the intent of congress in drafting that amendment which no one could dispositively prove	0
agree textualist is intellectually dishonest but the agenda is also conservative you don have liberal textualists arguing for gun control using the second amendment wording	0
actually its more complex than that the courts particularly those that would deal with this are stacked mostly with textualists who are judges that view the law as its written not as living document as judge right wing vs left wing actually matter less than legal perspective in understanding outcomes while yes more textualists are right wing leaning it would be fairly hard to get around the actual legal charges that would be brought from textualist position and if they were to abandon precedent etc that could be call for mistrial so it really depends if you think the judiciary is too far gone which certainly don	0
name cases that scalia ruled on in way other than what gop donors would want exactly all the textualists and originalists conveniently rule in whatever way the donor base wants as they are who write the amicus briefs telling them what to do none of these people including gorsuch and kavanaugh gave fidelity to anything other than the precarious whims of their backers good jurist would convince people with his rulings not of black money buying commercials	0
pretty much yeah especially considering that they love to use the power of judicial review which is mentioned nowhere in the constitution and wasn established until two and half decades after the constitution was written if they were real originalists textualists they wouldn have that power since the founders didn explicitly intend for the courts to be an equal power to the president and congress but lesser power	0
wouldn have that feeling if were you go read through the backlog of decisions until you get tired the conservative justices always follow the letter of the law while the liberal justices constantly push for judicial activism it so blatant that even incredibly left leaning institutions law schools teach it as some sort of philosophical divide the conservatives are criticized as textualists who mistakenly follow the laws that congress enacts and only apply the constitution and precedent to them while the liberal justices are praised for looking at purpose and social justice one of our sitting supreme court justices said mexican women are better judges of law because white men don have the rich experience of social justice that mexican women do	0
no results found sorry textualists and orginialists you lost	0
textualists oppose the current interpretation of the second amendment though and really don see gorsuch banning guns	0
it will be called legislation from the bench rejection of legislation from the bench is core argument made by textualist and originalist justices now textualists and originalists in the tradition of scalia are conveniently less concerned with this when socially conservative values are being promoted and yes they are hardly consistent	0
just want to point out that basically all of the justices on the supreme court are textualists which is word that predominately refers to statutory and not constitutional interpretation gorsuch and kagan are in fight right now for who is the most textualist justice	0
textualists often play tough love or ex ante approach to law where their goal in statutory interpretation is not to use judicial discretion to follow popular modern trends but instead to use judicial judgment objectively by finding the plain meaning of the text what is plain generally judge will try and find statutory definition or failing that dictionary definitions yes really scalia has literally used dictionaries to resolve some cases if the text is cruel or unjust it is for the legislature to democratically fix that the goal of textualists is said to be to encourage legislative consistency clarity and equity in the statutory text itself and avoid relying on undemocratic reformers in the executive or judicial branch to fix things	0
personally disagree textualists all too often find ways to select the plain meaning that supports their world view or party they show about as much discretion as any intentionalist or policy oriented judge with little of the heart and they fail to admit how cumbersome and rent-seeking legislation is not every small provision in million page legal code will be amended and textualism might allow gross injustice for centuries and finally some of the best cases that expanded civil rights flew in the face of textualism and this country is far better off for it	0
oh god with conservative textualists on the bench half expect the scotus to decide that since the founders never cared about gerrymandering or senate elections closed polling bribery and straight up owning other people neither should we	0
as elena kagan said we re all textualists now what trump and or his surrogates said on the campaign trail or on tv isn relevant to the legal analysis of the text and wouldn be considered material in courtroom	0
gt that why think these scalia textualists or originalists are full of shit there is always ambiguity that leads to judicial discretion at least the realists are honest about the source of that rather than reading statutes like tea leaves which coincidentally almost always end up supporting those conservative justices political views	0
get it you can admit that scalia methods were stunningly influential but elena kagan said we re all textualists now before scalia died eulogy it was not legislative history is bunkum	0
ok which modern day textualists reject the notion that common law norms apply at the federal level	0
was staunch cruz supporter who disliked his support for trump but seeing trump appoint textualists can see cruz was right the country is in better place because if cruz endorsement considering how thin trump win was it might have been one of the deciding factors in him winning	0
disagree completely well not completely agree that we elect presidents who are then charged with the duty of nominating justice to scotus during vacancy should vacancy occur during their term and we elect senators who are to provide advise and consent when vacancy occurs each of those parties need to perform their duty the intention of the founders could not have been that currently empty seats are filled out from the ballot box the people in charge of nominating and then voting on the nomination were already chosen by the previous electorate that my problem with constitutional textualists you can make any argument based on what is not written the founders did not forsee every scenario that could possibly play out based on their compromise of document they left it up to court interpretation	0
this is funny conservatives are textualists and thus nd amendment should only protect arms from when the constitution was written and what framers envisioned as arms but on the other hand most liberals view the constitution as living and breathing document that is written vaguely and thus it should be applicable to new inventions thus protecting other firearms besides those that existed when the constitution was written am about to blow your mind liberals are not trying to repeal the nd amendment	0
gt conservatives are textualists and thus nd amendment should only protect arms from when the constitution was written and what framers envisioned as arms	0
you understand that what you quoted is statute and that the constitution supercedes congressional statutes and it is exactly the kind of thing the judiciary decides judicial review marbury vs madison all that also not sure how your law school went over canons of statutory interpretation but that not correct it is common practice to look at extrinsic sources such as legislative history or other statements especially for an executive order are there textualists who insist on only looking at plain language yes but again that generally for statutes and it philosophy not rule as you presented it	0
modern textualists and strict constructionists are part of long line of people going back to the jeffersonians who are suspicious of the common law and see it as nefarious plot by the judiciary to seize power from the people they never say they are against common law but that it what they really are	0
the dirty secret of textualists is they don actually like the constitution that much they prefer the articles of confederation	0
change the constitution and the textualists will agree with it	0
originalists textualists are intellectual frauds they rarely use proper historical analysis to decipher original intent because that really hard and it not always clear	0

no not really cousin unless you are considering th to th don need no teddy lies spread besides being judges ambassadors congressmen number of walkers have been governors of ga fl il ut and wi scott is governor of wisconsin and was born to preacher in colorado springs and mother named patricia walker scott went from obscurity to political stardom overnight which to me suggests connections but am lacking any connecting details between him the branch that is close to the bushes in george bush jr while ex-president went to beloit wi referred to scott walker as his cousin but what he meant by that is up for discussion scott is republican like the walker-bush families has been close friend of george bush as well as one of his campaign helpers geo jr has said lots of silly nonsense comments so who knows what the real blood connection is between the scott george for sure they are close friends and by the way scott never went to yale or harvard while can answer that some of the walkers have been illuminati am unable to answer if or how scott walker might be related to that branch	0

live about half hour from the st district but lived in it for awhile the district has gone for gore and obama in so it not impossible ryan won those years because of his connections to the area and people views of him as hometown boy say randy got about as much chance of winning as trump did it ll take big blue wave in plus some ryan failures plus trump criticizing ryan so his supporters don come out for him all this could happen but it probably won the district is white and is mostly these small one industry southern wisconsin towns which have seen an increase of black and hispanic growth as people from chicago come up to work in these border towns larger towns janesville beloit racine and kenosha define it larger populations on either edge of the st racine and beloit have large black populations and are solid democratic towns janesville and kenosha are more white and lost gm plant and an engine factory in the last years but the old auto workers haven turned on ryan yet this will be how he loses when the old labor workers and children and grandchildren of the auto workers turn on him is when he loses the district kenosha is close to chicago and has turned into bedroom border town for people working in chicago looking for cheap houses the dem candidate in was nobody who got no money and no local activist support randy is probably going to win the nomination just based of his national recognition and money he gotten already randy has things going for him he has the bernie supporters volunteers coming out for him from madison and milw randy was huge bernie supporter and elector for him and the bernie supporters know it the other are just local political nobodies for the dem randy is also known for being big labor activist during the walker labor wars here in wi and he ll get help from what remains of the unions here who look for any way to fuck walker the triumvirate of evil republicans in this state are walker ryan and reince who together have led us to this place in the state and nation if we can take down we can take back the state	0

how do you justify him now being even with hilliary yeah go jump in lake to wash your neocon bushette dirt off if women compose of the population and if so many of them are voting for hilliary in an on par ratio hilliary should be winning by at least against trump now that we know the difference between conservative republican and faux cross over liberal like the bushettes as still the neocons that originally claimed to be reagan republicans when in all actuality they are secretly new world order globalist something that conservatives had never aspired to be before george bush got elected now there polls claiming all of sudden all the way up to of women supporting trump and will vote for him over hilliary the only democrat seen as capable of beating trump on women votes is bernie sanders unless hilliary can escape her coming downfall and trial for high treason trump vs bernie let put it this way the crooked hilliary clinton gig is up they ve got her personal blackberry phone now it just matter of back tracing her contacts and recovering emails from foreign donors to both clinton foundation and her campaign to see what state department favors she gave them in return it the only way she has of making more money on the side to get as rich as clintons are today she is screwed now that her racketeering in influence peddling around the world is coming unglued we now know state department secrets were gotten from her during her first trip to china with her totally insecure personal blackberry phone that had been banned from state department private network how did she get around that by using non-secure private email server which was set up by state department employee who is now pleading th so what does that tell you lol something was very wrong and he was afraid of being indicted now after receiving total amnesty over his involvement in setting up her private server he still refusing to testify they also know not only did the romanian hacker got into her email server but so have the russians and where they got in we re looking at the chinese all ecstatic that hilliary made it so easy for them to steal our secrets haha and we will all love when they are slapping the cuffs on hilliary and do you really think that this late in the game that you fools can get rd party candidate on the ballot in all states haha yeah it ll be cold day in hell rd party candidate can even get of the vote this late in the game	0
we need to repeat this all over the country kick all the faux conservative bushette neocons in this country to the curb this fall otherwise it ll be same same partisan politics we ve had with these back door funded neocons like this jerk wad saurkrauthammer mark pussy levin glen failed prophet beck crying baby weinstein bill shattered nut case crystal paul douche ryan etc	0
new world order bushettes like mark levin crying baby weinstein his koch and bush back door funded gf shill fields foiled attempt to kill trump nomination krauthammer etc all fearing an end is coming to all the hard work they ve put into making america not so great anymore in fact they are out to vanillanize and genericize america as part of their anti american hidden agenda yes these are anti americans every single one of them these neocons and rhinos are actually all former democratic conservatives before rolls were switched in our civil war the republicans were the radical revolutionaries in george wallace democratic era he was the last of conservative democrats some of those democrats have been moving to the republican party with their new world order globalist liberalism still in tact as neocons who don want to allow americans to love america first now all their back door funded by big banking and families of neocons like the bushettes and yeah that in the feminine sense since they are such pussies that like president johnson in vietnam war he played with american lives forbiding them to respond to being fired upon permission first like as if it was just chess game instead of concerning real american lives in danger these neocons both republican and democrats have never been real conservatives they only use it as shield to hide their true new world order globalism knowing these neocons like crying weinstein mark pussy levin saurkrauthammer the bushettes riding two guys in saddle while back door funding democratic new world order neoconism obama doesn want americans or businesses to be centered on americans or nationalist or even populists candidates to win because they will all be out of their back door a$$end fed funded jobs by foreigners bankers and our very own bush family globalist that not for americans that for global herds of sheeple kept dumb full of cumm and down on the farm in their idea of new world order feudal state where all americans are kept by the very rich banking families imf nwo etc marching through the nwo slaughter house gates trump wants to put america first by shoving these neocons back to where they started in the first place in the failed no longer conservative democratic party and that before they are able to completely turn themselves into global big brother herding us all around disposing of all the conservative principles this country was built on now get out and stay out of our politics here in the new america the beautiful again minus your foreign cash fueled puppets like obama hilliary mark levin saur krauthammer bushette pussies and the rest of their assorted puppets in media and politics but hey thanks to trump for president campaign waking us all up by separating the wheat from the chaff they done been shafted and like us they don like it lol	0
yeah there are good germans and bad germans just like good and bad americans the bad americans who think neocons have it right in going new world order globalists like bushette family soros koch bros saurkrauthammer bill crystal mark levin glen prophet of doom beck and all are endorsing globalism now believe if you aren for trump and america first then the general rule applies that if you aren for this country then you are against it and the future president of this country this was why the immigration and nationality act the mccarran-walter act was so prophetic for what happening today president trump doesn even have to ask congress to make new law banning muslims from us entry there already one on the books plus precedents set in our own and brits own history	0

folks especially you bleeding hearts in oregon doesn an illegal have to show proof of auto insurance coverage and at certain minimums of coverage at least in pa we do before the driver instructor sets foot inside the vehicle it because duh you have bunch of student drivers inside relatively small piece of acreage and who amongst us hasn heard story of guy at the driver license test place into another vehicle and was immediately failed on the spot fill in the blank and in order to get an insurance company little recap here of how they work pool of citizens contribute money so as to alleviate the risk when the inevitable happens to otherwise conscientious citizenry who tryna live in world where everyone is either in hurry or traveling at mph and to cover you one must show legal residence so when the inevitable does happen they know where to send the check they also have to know where to send the renewal forms every months and take hypothetical example five illegals from central or south america who ve illegally crossed the border cram themselves into bedroom apartment one of them obtains driver license and runs up parking violations speeding tickets or whatever until the long arm of the law gets too close and then the next illegal gets his license and all move to different bedroom address all the time sending of their wages back to the real home in central or south america my point is obeying traffic law means nothing if you know that you re only requirement to being an honest law abiding citizen is time period of months and one day haven any of you ever watched an episode of cops and how many times have you seen someone who doesn speak english too gooder admit right off that they have no license or insurance card having the ability to drive vehicle means very little if you can meet the financial responsibility of owning the right to operate vehicle driving car in pa is right not privilege that what is says on the top of every insurance renewal form ve ever turned in and by the way haven had to turn in any requests for auto insurance in over years yet ve contributed to the pool religiously just as all the other drivers are required yet each year hit with the surcharge for uninsured motorists coverage is it because of oregonians	0

years and years ago on the old ellen sitcom show there was dream sequence scene in which she made quite amorous pass at her male psychiatrist instant shark jump because said to myself if people can figure out what she is and how hollow this rings then what the point this was about year before she came out and ever since ve always questioned ellen sincerity about anything mean you always knew rosie donnell was what she was and that the whole my little tommy cruise thing was to rope in the na ve old biddies out there and that rosie always was nasty piece of work but ellen didn seem that way and still doesn seem nasty so much as insincerely nice without the same baggage as rosie that why have hard time watching her feel like watching eddie haskell in sorta drag of kind if you get what tryna say here	0

my only concern is all the dead mexicans on the other side of the wall after about month it will make trump look like the bad guy even though he not we ve got to think ahead proactively to prevent this massive pr nightmare am totally on board with the wall don get me wrong it definitely needs to be built just worried that there will be hundreds of dead children corpses rotting away in the mexican sun on the other side of the wall and we the trump conservatives will come off looking horrible and please don reply that am heartless get it they re human beings etc the point is they are choosing to come to the wall so dying at it is their own fault not trump we ve got to find solutions now for example working with the mexican police to transport people back to safety in their own cities or providing emergency food water to those who make it to the wall or maybe nightly soylent green truck to pick up those who do die dunno just tryna think ahead to preclude pr nightmare	0

could search for thousand years and not find better quote to demonstrate why you people are going nowhere except the breitbart comment sections the republican party has become an insurgent outlier ideologically extreme contemptuous of the inherited social and economic policy regime scornful of compromise unpersuaded by conventional understanding of facts evidence and science and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition bingo chief you people are the minority do you honestly think we are going to build trumptastic and beautiful mile wall do you honestly think we are deporting million people do you honestly think climate change isn happening until you people re learn that politics is the art of negotiation and compromise you will never ever never be anything except the sound and and fury signifying-nothing	1

trumptastic may millions of americans ride the trumpnami to victory trump making america the greatest	1
as wrote it shame you re trying to make this into something it not trump was shamelessly opportunistic in going down to louisiana when he was asked not to do so trump could have easily earmarked several millions worth of housing for the affected residents know if been there wouldn care about pressing the flesh and saying thank you for my daily bread to the man who merely passing it out on bread line and would have preferred being given mini-house from which to reconstruct my life that wasn what trump chose to do he made his typical trumptastic choice	1

trump stumps the chumps yet again his ability to seeming negative to trumptastic positive is breathtakingly wonderful the guy is an absolute genius and worth his weight in presidential platinum	1
trumplisciously trumptastic ballz bravado and benevolence	1
just when we thought the trump campaign couldn get much stranger br br the prospect of russians ukrainians or other hostile foreign interests actively subverting elections is horrifying prospect this latest revelation shows that mr trump allegiances are hopelessly compromised the risk of him and his organization being russian mole is too great it is rapidly becoming apparent that he is much more than just narcissistic blowhard he is serious and fundamental threat to american freedom and democracy br br it time for the american people to soundly reject mr trump and his trumptastic campaign as well as the party that advanced him as serious candidate for the presidency the future of our republic and our very independence is at stake	1
it has made hundreds of nuclear warheads with help of china and making more more like crazy there are many mad muisis there from whom the world is in extreme danger pakistan needs to be dispossessed of all it nukes fast as it is the only islamic country in the world which has nukes now and isis is planning to get control over the nukes as well as the whole country and who already have many people there to support join them	1
don hold your breath and forget machine guns as the muisis are planning to get hold of and then use porkistani nukes	1
so in gun free australia muisis are shooting freely	1
buyback programme won be problem for him as the muisis with the oil money are ready to buy all the guns available and come as armed ruff-ugees to us	1
that only reserved for the muisis his brethren	1
muisis follower	1
that what most muisis are	1
muisis themselves are the plaague so they are immune better hope for something else	1
get that muisis brother hussein out of the wh before he starts war with russia which is on turkey shoot	1
not we only that muisis brother hussein in the wh	1
or don hurt my muisis brothers	1
because he always wanted to help and not defeat the muisis something like muisis brotherhood	1
it all planned unarmed invasion by the muisis of eu us	1
it barry who is scheming to get muisis in us eu	1
even dud missiles would scare the he ll out of those muisis	1
does anyone know how many missiles that muisis brother hussein fired at isis in so many years like russia did	1
you must read world history again as it was the muisis following their propht mo-mad and his book who started j-had in the th century and went on to loot and kill millions brutally who refused to become muisis like zoroastrians in persia and the hindu kingdoms that were spread over what is now afghanistan pakistan india and bangladesh most of the hindu population there except in india has become negligible as they were either killed or converted by swords muisis have destroyed thousands of ancient hindu temples in all of these countries and even now not letting the hindu reconstruct even few of these main temples and that also in india where hindu are in vast majority for example the temple in the birth place of their main god ram in ayodhya uttarpradesh india the history of which you can google and find out for which they are still fighting and millions of hindu have died over hundreds of years for this temple alone this is proof enough that they were and still are trying to destroy all other religions and their heritage	1
the christians and other religions have already discarded these sort of later on added and not original commands as where do you see christians stoning anyone today anywhere in the world on these issues but on the other hand you will most certainly find muisis indulging in mass scale in all such cruel activities	1
if there were had been no crusades all christians etc would have forcefully at the tip of sword converted now to muisis today or killed even you if already not and so that is how nature works even an ant fights back to survive and if you can find that laughable next am sure that those quotes of luke etc regarding killing non christians were added later on by ordinary men to counter the book as the proof is there for all to see in how originally jesus christ preached love towards even enemies by turning the other cheek if hit non violence and how the book propht mo-mad preached kill all innocent if they refuse to follow my book brutally- extreme violence	1
this is catch situation where you have very difficult decision to make this is the biggest plus point muisis have where if you are unable to make decision to cut away some of the good part as doctor will let just few of the remaining cancer cells to easily multiply and spring back and you are back to square one	1
swedenistan would not be appropriate as sthan is hindu word meaning place and pakistan afghanistan etc were all hindu kingdoms originally which were later invaded and captured by deceit by these muisis and their names were changed only leaving the original word sthan or stan left in it	1
next the main problem is that accursed book which has been the bane of mankind over thirteen centuries not arguing for the book or denying the barbaric philosophy it suggests all saying is that to claim that billion muslims in this planet interpret said book the same and enact the barbarism in it the way isis does it is an unsubstantiated uttering that doesn withstand the most basic scrutiny this would be like saying that billion christians or even the millions in medieval europe are and were morally corrupt because of what inquisitors did in the name of their god and interpreting his sacred book what am trying to say is as steel cuts steel and poison required to kill poison so law of nature resulted in crusades etc and resulted in brutality being required to end muisis brutality your implying that the crusades were simply very christian and justified response to muslim invasion is just laughable but again it not what arguing here arguing that those invasions are no proof that all muslims in this planet today are some sort of radical terrorists too many of them are and way too many condone it no more than the barbarism of christians trying to make claims over the same strip of land as muslims and jews for millennia is any indication that all christians are murderers the book has been source of brutality the world over for centuries and will continue to be source of inspiration or excuse for mass murderers muisis again the same can be argued about the bible how are quran calls to murder the infidel different to luke deuteronomy and dozens more this does not mean in the slightest that all christians will kill the non believer just because they are christian and thankfully christians stopped doing that centuries ago some muslim theocracies still live in the th century so they still do it	1
well in the first place used the metaphor of ostrich with head in sand generally and not specifically for you just an example to illustrate my point so please don mind it next the main problem is that accursed book which has been the bane of mankind over thirteen centuries this book has poisned the whole world atmosphere forget all religions for moment and think rationaly according to the law of physics each and every action has an equal and opposite reaction what am trying to say is as steel cuts steel and poison required to kill poison so law of nature resulted in crusades etc and resulted in brutality being required to end muisis brutality for example and god forbid if you are in the wilderness far away from society and you see your family members being put to death brutally by certain group of people time and again and only you manage to escape since they are after you also and there is no one else to stop them you will most probably give up any religion you follow that preaches non violence and try your best to destroy that whole group of people brutally to teach them lesson as all are responsible even if they just watched it and you can choose as you don know who out of that group will come to kill you next the book has been source of brutality the world over for centuries and will continue to be source of inspiration or excuse for mass murderers muisis also don forget of all major religions only this book teaches to kill anyone who does not follow it	1
you cannot just brush down centuries of muisis invasions and butchery all over the world under the carpet am not just saying that the butchery that went on centuries ago is no proof that all current muslims are butchers just like christian butchery of the past in no way represents the beliefs and worldview of current christians plenty of butchery too by christians and by hindus and atheists you name the religion or lack thereof there has been lot of butchering heir brutal actions on such massive scales are proof enough that the interpretations of their book for centuries were exactly the same as to what isis is now interpreting agree wholeheartedly but that isis interpreting them as you accurately indicate too many muslims millions of them don enact them but condone it with their silence but plenty of muslims reject them and interpret their holy book differently	1
being an ostrich with your head in the sand won help hide the fact that millions of muisis have taken part in these barbaric killings for over thirteen centuries all over the world in the name of their bloody book am not denying that neither am burying my head in the sand islamic terrorism is big problem an existential problem worldwide on my toes on top of politicians and their decisions and how they will affect us should they be bad policy what arguing is the extreme position of labeling all muslims some sort of dangerous terrorist do you realize we are talking about billion people if you claim to know how each one of of the inhabitants of this planet interpret their holy book then you are delusional otherwise you say that much experience of butchery certainly allows their class to pass with high marks given certificate of phd in butchery the same can be said about any religion specially the abrahamic ones but also of hinduism norse religions buddhism etc as well as atheism with various degrees in the way of amount of people butchering plenty of butchering on the christian side lot less than muslims in the past few decades believe it matter of wickedness of man and their interpretation of bad worldviews rather than the religions themselves	1
what is clearly recorded in world history books about mass scale butchery and invasions by muisis based on their book interpretation has remained exactly the same for centuries and there is no contradiction whatsoever with the present isis interpretation of the book	1
you cannot just brush down centuries of muisis invasions and butchery all over the world under the carpet their brutal actions on such massive scales are proof enough that the interpretations of their book for centuries were exactly the same as to what isis is now interpreting there was and is no difference at all	1
if you read world history you will get your proof clearly written in black white maybe you will be able to see all the red color also which comes from the blood of millions and millions people butchered by them year after year decade after decade century after century being an ostrich with your head in the sand won help hide the fact that millions of muisis have taken part in these barbaric killings for over thirteen centuries all over the world in the name of their bloody book that much experience of butchery certainly allows their class to pass with high marks given certificate of phd in butchery don you think	1
that too real slow in slow motion that why they even teach their children to practice on animals first hellall let em bleed writh in pain fast quick won be fun for those barbarian muisis	1
the land of the free and the brave being turned into land of the free and barbarian muisis	1

fox-news style angry rhetoric and lack of fact-checking appears to have been adopted by sanders and his supporters the bitter vitriol and random insults bernheads are lobbing at the clintons lack insight or intelligence for example to say sanders will protect women better than clinton or bill was adulterer-in-chief speaks volumes about the knee-jerk robotic lines find incredibly shallow and disappointing when coming from democrats republicans don surprise me this election cycle democrats do	1
reading the comments here truly depresses me the bernheads repeat every canard about clinton that fox watchers do without any sense of irony that they re spouting stories promoted for more than two decades by right-wing think tanks and media and apparently like bernie himself they have absolutely no interest in making alliances with other democrats at the federal and state level condemning mrs clinton for raising money on behalf of the dnc which will help elect other democrats as selling out and buying friends and quid pro quo yet bernie after years in washington can name at best five or six members of the house and senate who support him he has few allies who will help him get anything done if he is elected br br after three decades of deliberately refusing to join the democratic party he now wants the democratic party to give him support even to the point of fantasizing that the super-delegates will suddenly turn to him as their savior the new fdr br br reality check having survived years of smear campaigns by the kochs the rutherford institute heritage foundation and the rest of the right hillary is still standing and still fighting watch the hour gowdy grilling polls showing bernie as stronger candidate reflect only the fact that the right-wing hate machine has not aimed bb gun much less its full artillery against the one-issue socialist from vermont when they do his general election campaign will go down in flames	1
last year found that many friends preferred sanders over clinton we disagreed over their qualifications experience electability etc but agreed that both were highly intelligent competent patriots looking to lead the country based on their generally shared progressive worldview what kept cropping up was the sanders supporters nebulous complaint that they just don trust clinton when pressed as to why they regurgitated all the claims and accusations made by the gop against her over the past years br br these are very liberal democrats many of them women over but not one has ever offered hard fact to back up their dislike of her in way they re mirror images of hillary with doctorates retired from successful careers in law education government and all but one either single or divorced to tell the truth started wondering if they were simply envious of the woman who has it all marriage that survived tough times career fame money power etc who knows br br but the more read the venomous comments calling clinton liar nixonesque corporate shill etc wonder how in touch with reality many of bernie supporters are there never been shred of evidence of any wrongdoing even bernie couldn name single instance of her being influenced by wall street ties but some bernheads seem ready to swallow even the vince foster fairy tale br br congratulations to the rutherford institute for its successful year jihad against her	1
as lifelong progressive gotta say that if the only thing knew about bernie sanders was the vehemence vitriol and anger that his supporters express toward hillary clinton every time they open their mouths--in comment sections polling and interviews--i would have to conclude that their candidate is not someone could ever support dedicated liberals who have worked for political progress over lifetime in civil rights gay rights voting access housing economic and environmental activism and other issues--in other words people like me--can and do legitimately disagree over which candidate among the democrats is best suited to lead the country and most likely to accomplish shared goals but bernheads who disparage clinton at every turn and who use right-wing republican arguments and tactics to weaken her are as foolish as the so-called liberals who voted for nader in and are responsible at least as much as the supreme court for giving us eight years of george dubya bush br sanders is decent man with fanatic following and radical vision of economics and moderate view of policy clinton is decent woman with moderate view of economics and realistic view of policy possibilities both are bright and accomplished both are far better options than any of the republicans hoping to install theocratic autocracy over our country but the purists who can only build up bernie by tearing down hillary are the worst kind of partisans	1

from now on will all ages call me blessed luke therefore we all better have great respect for jesus mother well if you won take st jerome word for it because he not early enough for you then go even earlier earlychristians the testimony of the fathers of the church the first father of the church who wrote about mary is st ignatius of antioch he defended the veracity of the humanity of christ against the docetists by affirming that jesus pertained to the line of david because he was born of mary jesus was conceived by mary he came from her and this conception was virginal and pertains to the most hidden mysteries in the silence of god in his book dialogue with trypho st justin insists on the reality of the human nature of jesus and as consequence of that human nature he insists also of the maternity of mary over jesus like st ignatius of antioch st justin emphasizes the virginal conception saint justin bases his marian reflections on the eve mary parallelism as the passage of genesis suggests and this perspective which is incorporated in his theology will serve as the basis of the marian reflections of the later fathers of the church st irenaeus focuses on the reality of the human corporeality of jesus and that he really came from the womb of mary to combat the prevailing gnostic and docetic beliefs moreover he bases on the divine motherhood his christology it is the human nature assumed by the son of god in the womb of mary that gives to the redemptive value of the death of jesus its universality its applicability to all men he emphasizes also the motherhood of mary in relation to the new adam christ and her cooperation in the work of redemption the north african father tertullian during the dispute with marcion gnostic affirms that mary is the mother of christ because jesus was engendered by mary in her womb during the third century the use of theot kos mother of god in greek became more widespread origen was the first to apply this title to mary among the prayers of supplication the title first appeared in the prayer sub tuum praesidium that as mentioned earlier is the oldest known marian prayer during the fourth century in opposition to the doctrine of arius the confession of faith of bishop alexander of alexandria contains the same title since then it gained universality and many were the holy fathers who reflected and studied in depth the truth that mary is the mother of god among them were st ephrem st athanasius st basil st gregory of nyssa st gregory of nazianzus st ambrose st augustine proclus of constantinople etc because of these mother of god became the most frequent title applied to mary the truth of the divine maternity of mary was proclaimed as dogma of the church in the council of ephesus in here are other quotes for your consideration and understanding the church has always professed that mary was virgin ante partum in partu et post partum before birth during birth and after the birth of christ mary conceived jesus in her womb by the power of the holy spirit without loss of her virginity she remained virgin in giving birth to jesus his miraculous birth did not diminish her virginal integrity but sanctified it vatican ii lumen gentium no following the birth of jesus mary remained virgin for the rest of her earthly life until such time as she was taken body and soul into heaven where she reigns as queen lumen gentium no the doctrine of mary perpetual virginity brings to light two distinct errors that are rooted in misconceptions concerning the nature of divine revelation the first error is the sola scriptura approach that collapses the word of god to merely that which has been written thereby denying the role of tradition and the magisterium curiously such position developed during the protestant reformation is not taught in scripture indeed the testimony of scripture conveys otherwise for example in thessalonians st paul exhorts his followers to stand firm and hold fast to the traditions they were taught either by an oral statement or by letter in timothy st paul further states that the church is the pillar and bulwark of the truth sola scriptura constitutes an attempt to understand scriptures apart from mother church even though the church was alive for decades before the new testament in its entirety was written and for centuries before the church definitively determined which texts were inspired	0

what does regret have to do with anything if you subsitute the phrase giving up your child for adoption for abortion in the following sentence it is undoubtably true but does that mean mr parker opposes the practice of adopition br br mr parker filed brief on behalf of more than women many identified by their first names or initials who say they suffered psychological or physical harm from their abortions br br and couldn we subsitute the word childbirth for abortion here some women suffer terribly from either their pregnancies or their childbirth experiences myself know at least one woman with heart condition who died while pregnant another who experienced multiple organ failure as result of her pregnancy and ended up needing kidney tranplant and another who almost died due to preclampsia and that does not even begin to touch on post partum depression or gestational diabetes that persists after pregnancy severe varicose veins that make it painful to stand stresses on the family when there are inadequate resources or when the child has special needs that change life forever br br perhaps brief should be filed by all the unloved abused or inadequately cared for children in the world maybe we should make sure those kids needs are taken care of before we consider championing the rights of fetuses	0

obamunism	1
out with obama down with obamunism	1
fact the reps were going to stop obamunism after they took the house and senate but all they ve done is obey zero and support his marxist policies the reps gave us the last milquetoast candidates that couldn beat lying incompetent blaming crybaby and they want america to trust them again trump is simply the byproduct of the rep failures if they hate him all they need do is look in the mirror as to why	1
sarah has it wrong the republicantz are like rats carrying the bubonic plague of obamunism and we are the exterminators if the black panthers can put bounty on an innocent man for defending his own life against son-of-obama then we should be able to do the same for today rinos as well as anyone else who is responsible for letting in more muslim scum or giving america jobs to foreigners ultimately there should probably be bounties on the heads of all the elites who are behind the betrayal of law-abiding tax-paying american people who wouldn like to see the faces of exec-traitors from disney microsoft and facefukk etc etc on wanted doa posters	1

here is the silver lining to the cloud which is obamunism precedent every rule obama tosses out or imposes every eo obama dispenses every constitutional twist which democrats can cheer loudly being the idiots they are become the obama rule that is the legal precedent for gop administration to use on liberalism as well as to undo all of obamunism by fiat based on the precedents of the obama rules nothing obama does other than money wasted and gone is permanent unless subsequent administration likes it too	1

the idiots should ve have gotten behind the nominee the minute he became so had bush been treated by fellow reps like this he have been appalled fact trump is nothing but byproduct of their actions why they whined they would stop obamunism if they just had the house which america gave them in landslide crybabies bohener and mcconnell did nothing except ask for the senate which america gave them in landslide all they ve done with both is obey obama and support his marxist policies lastly the reps gave us milquetoast pc correct wimps that couldn beat jug eared lying incompetent crying blaming infant and they wanted us to trust them with another wimp like jeb please clap bush america has had it with lying corrupt pc correct establishment politicians who ve given the finger to america and trump is their voice in the end if you reps aren happy with trump look in the mirror the image is why he there btw the luck we re going to need is if lying corrupt hillary and her impeached disbarred serial womanizing filthy husband get back in the wh america will indeed be doomed	1
obamunism has failed good	1
well that is fair criticism but let us remember the disaster known as the jfk admin is what doomed cuba and at that point if you and your family were fighting for your country against the commies you were about to lose and lose you lives so running in that situation is forgivable live to fight another day of course that never happened cuba was lost to larger issues vietnam am old enough to say remember those events but too young to have been pulled into that you had to be there to understand what was happening but will say this it is eerily similar to what has been happening under obamunism the commiecrats scuttled nam then they almost scuttled iraq in but kerry was sent packing unfortunately that was temp victory as the commiecrats took the legislature in then obama in and iraq and afghanistan was soon scuttled look at what is happening there now with people who you probably broke bread with and appreciated you for being there to win their freedom they were abandoned as was done with vietnam and if they run now as they should since what awaits for them with isis is beyond horrific you should not think less of them for it same with senor cruz	1

bias against trump destroyed trump associated with the clintons as businessman not as republican frontrunner you trumpshitter you lie with your head firmly up your is that all you ve got just more of the same lame bulls lies about trump all of which have been disproven disavowed and destroyed idiot no matter how wicked and evil the clintons are proven to be with each passing day you stupid trumpshitters always seem to blame trump for it how the does that work bill clinton helped to orchestrate yes it certainly was on the table before and the clintons were instrumental in seeing through to that point deceived one boy you demonbrats are so gullible and stupid that you still vote for shitlary even if she walked up on stage and took trump wants to send blacks back to africa and other insane rhetoric from the left yesterday watched cnn as they waited for trump rally in phoenix to commence cnn ran interviews on its side panel while waiting for trump to address the crowd as trump approached the podium cnn broke away from its trump is bad guy interviews to cover his speech they covered the first minutes and then broke away to the same news stories they had been running in the segment prior to trump speech why did cnn suddenly break away from trump they did so because he was educating the audience about the evils of free trade agreements and any outlet owned by ted turner cannot have the ignorant learning about what free trade agreements have done to our country what cnn did is representative of renewed attack upon donald trump in an attempt to recruit low iq voters to abandon trump and support clinton trump wants to send blacks back to africa black lives matter supporter located at donald trump rally in atlanta protester made the absurd comment trump wants to ship black people back to africa he also stated that trump wife is an illegal immigrant because she is from europe implying that all european people are in america illegally if trump truly wanted to ship all blacks back to africa then why are there so many tens of thousands of blacks voting for him including myself guess we all want to be shipped backed to africa too lying ignorant jon this is case of stupid people being galvanized electrified and hopelessly used to propagandize other stupid people wrote earlier last week that the poor and the stupid are both being organized against trump this is prime example of what am talking about make america mexico trump is member of the kkk protesters at donald trump campaign stop in phoenix arizona put up an inflatable trump figure outfitted in kkk grand wizard uniform saturday this is absolutely an outrageous claim that goes unchecked by the msm however this stupid message is designed to manipulate stupid people alex jones recognized the false flag of stupidity being used against trump alex jones breaks down the big secret behind the media attempt to use dead people from orlando as platform to push their agenda to destroy donald trump and his quest for the white house the view from the toilet the following video is one of the most outrageous accusations have seen on network television the moronic and member of the view joy behar stated the aftermath of the orlando shooting stated that donald trump is working with isis to kill us there is absolutely no basis in fact for this statement and there isn even the remotest fact that behar could point to in order to justify her statement and where are the censors for the network that they would let such ridiculous and scandalous statement get on the airwaves and what about the show producers this event is the poster child for the media attack that has just restarted in its efforts to discredit donald trump who would believe such nonsense before answer that question please watch the video and marvel at the gross ignorance of the participants on the view and then be prepared to be shocked as behar makes these absurd allegations against trump who would believe this nonsense about trump the answer to this question is simple america has become dumbed down nation education is supposed to be the great equalizer innovation and creativity derived from education make up the well-spring of scientific development america is th in the world in reading st in science and rd in math fifty five percent of americans cannot find great britain on map eighty percent cannot find iraq on map over of all americans cannot name the current vice-president gee is that all trump fault too stupid people will believe these ridiculous messages being perpetrated by george soros and the mainstream media now it is true that most of these targeted morons will not vote but enough will to swing an election the method used to deliver the propaganda where have we heard the following statement tell big enough lie often enough the masses will come to believe it psychologists refer to this process as confirmation bias confirmation bias works because the research shows that if people are exposed to the same message often enough whether true of untrue people will believe the statement as fact the ignorant are especially vulnerable to the use of confirmation bias because stupid people have little information from which to do fact any meaningful fact checking on the propaganda that they are being fed the answer the only surefire way to counteract this media bias and moronic grass roots attacks upon trump is to do the same thing to hillary clinton in reverse and do so in greater volume therefore it is incumbent that all trump supporters get into the bash hillary movement democrats bunch of rich people convincing poor people to vote for the rich people by telling the poor people that other rich people are the reason they re poor jon always remember the only difference

it ok bernie is socialist running for the dummycrat nomination nothing to see here move along	1
you must get out and vote no matter how big the lead how true indeed just hope all of the people on our side have the sense to get behind whomever the nominee is even christie bush or kasich is better than hillary or bernie at least we would stand chance at undoing much of the damage caused by obama that will be continued by any dummycrat succeeding the oval office whomever the nominee and hopefully the next president if it is republican such person will have to know about their constituents new-shown disdain for establishment democrat-like voting patterns pc and politics we are fed up with it all of it if such president and members of congress ignore what is happening in their constituents on the republican side it will be their political doom thus they will be pressured to undo as many as obama socialist executive ordered undermining-america damages as they can manage that is the atmosphere any republican president and congress will inherit if dummycrat gets in they literally will change the air atmosphere will mean nothing cringe at the thought that some of us will pout and show our butts refusing to vote at all because their favorite didn get the nomination what hillary or bernie is better such notion is ridiculously stupid not to mention the spaces on the supreme court justice will be up for grabs this really is the most important election most of us will see in our lifetimes it is essential that we band together and defeat the socialist cronies that strong like rubio said are trying to change america strong they will too make no mistake about that this is our last chance no words are as profound	1
we need to be asking who is the most electable and get behind him we are not going to solve all our problems in one term anyway by any one candidate either but we can at least do what we can like repeal obamacare undo the socialist president executive orders have at least chance to keep out all the illegals who want our jobs money politics and more not to mention that seats of the scotus are up for grabs in the next president hands we must keep our wits if we are going to outsmart the socialist scheme to transform america into amerika we will not win if we do not nominate the most electable strong like it or not hate the way politics are but if we do not nominate the most electable we will not win bank on it strong am not saying cruz is the most electable am saying that whoever is we need to be doing that one while my personal choice is trump think the most electable is rubio rubio is in the middle between rino and anti-establishment trump types like me thus if both sides of our broken party gravitate to the middle both sides will get at least something closer to what they wanted compared to one extreme over the other and certainly compared to if either dummycrat takes the oval office to continue obama damages if we do not strategically think and organize this way we will lose is it more important to pout about things or to win the wh want to know how the dummyrats keep winning easy they stick together come general election us well does that need answering keep your wits	1
how do you know what have or have not done and don care to hold candle to orthodox jews am not in competition with orthodox jews why do so many conservatives engage in th grade name-calling lol rino jino libtard idiot dummycrat etc that sh yr old boy engages in	1
glad to see there are others who are calling marxist marxist rather than the feel-good term of dummycrat which applies to anything left of center if the gop did this they be excoriated by the media and forced to use different terminology but democrat is apparently part of the overall death to america leftist and complicit rino gop strategy	1

liberals promise to self-deport but it turns out to be just more liberal dummycrat lies	1
actually mgtow can be and do whatever they wish simply because we do not take cues from anyone or defer to the herd---men or women---to determine our own worth no one is granted access to my control panel that only own power and operate my personal choice to go my own way has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with my political philosophies and just because think we should remain united against hillary and her socialism doesn mean that being mgtow is up for others to try and define stand firm in my commonsense position that any republican is better than any dummycrat do not like bush but he will get my vote before just run off and pout and not vote at all because my favorite didn get the nomination	1
didn call you names and am not going to am here to keep us united and not have repeat failure to take the wh there is lesser of the two evils even if slight rubio is better than hillary obama and sanders at the very least we can send signal to the democrats that conservatives have regrouped and will fight them by controlling elections know many of the republican candidates are rinos and practically democrats in their politics but it is senseless to not vote for whomever is the nominee any republican is better than any democrat we may not get our way on it all but rubio will vote against most dummycrat ideas if stubborn people who claim to be conservative do not vote for the nominee they surely will feel guilty for even more socialism and obama-like legislation not to mention three likely replacements for supreme court justices honestly is there any one here that is willing to take the chance that hillary will appoint conservatives to the court rubio will most any republican will we are on the same side but we must also keep our wits to do all we can no matter how tiny to keep hillary out it is not daft to do at least what we can but it might be to allow them to steamroll us all ask is that everyone remain united	1
am sure it is there know believe me know that is not the overall priority point am making but isn rubio at least notch better than hillary or sanders rubio has stated interest in repealing obamacare just for starters all of obama damage will remain if hillary or sanders gets in but if rubio gets in even if he is not our favorite certainly not mine at least it is better than the alternative will vote for rubio before help hillary or sanders no-vote for rubio in the general election is yes-vote for the democrats remember hillary is socialist too she is just trying to cover it up have you heard him speak about hillary rubio is passionately against hillary and most of the dummycrat socialist ideas rubio is not my favorite but he is better than any democrat mean come on we have got the attention of republican candidates that we are tired of their democrat-like politics it is unrealistic to expect massive change like we want all in one single election too it is illogical to take such stance on this that one doesn vote at all come general election am here trying to keep us united it is critical to abort the damage caused by obama even if we can get rescinded all his damage shouldn we take what we can get peace brother we are on the same side let do what it takes to not have repeat divided party that gives hillary the win if we do not stop this runaway socialism and mindless pc this election there will be no turning back take the chance to do at least whatever we can please	1
there was time when actually liked paul ryan but now wouldn give him second thought changed my view because paul has essentially become left wing dummycrat who worries more about obama than any conservatives in this country and since he became speaker of the house he has been an absolute failure he cannot even control his own caucus nor does he have any brass to push back against the obama regime on anything finally the way he has treated donald trump is despicable he has become too big for his own little boy pants paul now personifies what is wrong with the cesspool we call washington dc none of those people actually give damned about one american citizen they do not govern in the best interest of the american people they are all too busy catering to the very people that buy their seats in congress every elections ryan like the rest are owned by the special interests they are only interested in worshiping the pictures of dead presidents am no longer republican because detest what they stand for am an independent conservative american should vote out of office every politician running for re-election they are the problem just like paul ryan	1
live in nj and can tell you it solid blue state ugh if abraham lincoln could come back to life and run for office he would lose to any dummycrat they could run against him look back to nj was one of only two states not to side with lincoln in the presidential election so it should come as no surprise that trump is behind here	1

actually libertarian socialist usually does prefer smaller government the difference between left-libertarians libsoc and right-libertarians majority of americans who self-identify as libertarians is that right-libertarians are comfortable with political and economic power welling up in the hands of large for-profit entities while left-libertarians would see political and economic power distributed among pluralistic patchwork of social organizations and worker-owned enterprises someone more knowledgeable can feel free to correct my correction	0

attention american citizens it official your courts have turned against you in the battle against foreign criminals in the united states of america you should now expect courts to discriminate against american citizens and in favor of foreign criminals do not turn to the court system to seek justice where crimes committed by foreign criminals have been committed crimes such as obamacide see will now be tolerated by american courts acting in illegal support of president obama obamacide noun definition murder committed by foreign nationals in the usa illegally under the protection of the administration of president barrack hussein obama thru an unconstitutional executive order that allowed the foreign born criminals to remain in the us even after federal district and appeals courts ordered the unconstitutional policy to stop in these crimes president obama is considered an accessory before the fact and conspirator to committ the crime see also related crimes obamanapping obamafraud obamarape obamasmuggling obamaelection fraud obamaprostitution obamaarmed robbery obamaassault obamaextortion	1

moderators please don delete their posts make up your mind you poor frightened little muslimophobe just below you said that you flagged my post again	0
wisdom is never irrelevant right you stated to me that as irrelevant as what jesus would approve of and not at all provocative you poor frightened little muslimophobe netanyahu is weanie and fool this is not about fear it is all about respect that is something that you are incapable of understanding right did you learn nothing from the following hateful jewish caricatures are condemned per foreign policy res of the th congress hateful islamic caricatures must also be condemned right next you stated israel government places legal restrictions on its citizens natural human right to blaspheme islamically what you call muslim baiting people can be and have been jailed in israel for harmlessly defacing koran that is strong indicator that geller muslim baiting must be condemned right grow some moral fiber please	0
that as irrelevant as what jesus would approve of and not at all provocative you poor frightened little muslimophobe netanyahu is weanie and fool like many european countries israel government places legal restrictions on its citizens natural human right to blaspheme islamically what you call muslim baiting people can be and have been jailed in israel for harmlessly defacing koran	0
people must stop the muslim-baiting before geller provokes another terrorist attack have better idea muslims must marginalize their pan geller-provokers if they want to reduce her and the rest of the non-muslim world disrespect for the barbarian warlord mohammed and the ideology he invented you can stop billion non-muslims from speaking their minds about mohammed mockery be upon him especially the rd of billion americans whose natural right to blaspheme is protected from government interference by our first amendment very good way to provoke many americans into saying what we think about islam is to tell us that we not must speak our minds freely or else you and some delicate flowers who can bear to know that somebody somewhere is insulting islam or the a$$h le who invented it may figure this out someday but won hold my breath your fear of muslim reactions to people speaking uncomfortable truths about islam is obsessive and pathetic you are muslimophobe harmless drawings of the pedophile prophet are very bad reason to attack innocent people there are endless bad reasons for jihadis to act like jihadis you couldn jihadi-proof your life by eliminating one of them even if it were possible to do so you poor frightened dear	0
you stated you re still very confused about what incitement is you poor frightened muslimophobe neither charlie hebdo nor pamela geller urged muslims to kill anybody wrong it is you who are not only confused you are very deceitful and manipulative geller knew ahead of time that extremist muslims will be incited to violence if she depicted cartoons of muhammad given that she chose to depict cartoons of muhammad in order to drive extremist muslims crazy and to violence that was hateful and cruel act because geller did not care at all about collateral damage to law enforcement and the public grow some moral fiber please	0
you re still very confused about what incitement is you poor frightened muslimophobe neither charlie hebdo nor pamela geller urged muslims to kill anybody that incitement came entirely from the violent infidelophobic teachings of the barbarian warlord mohammed pig hit and mockery be upon him and from the pens keyboards and mouths of some devout muslims who take those vile and bigoted teachings too seriously and speaking of ignorance the two events shown should be enough to get the us congress thinking about change in strategy to include muslim clause not that different from how antisemitism is treated you will not see the us congress try to outlaw islamic blasphemy in your lifetime anti-semitism isn analogous to drawing mohammed pebuh criticizing his teaching or blaspheming islamically drawing moses criticizing judaic teachings or blaspheming judaically is analogous to drawing mohammed pebuh criticizing his teaching or blaspheming islamically one can do any or all of these things without hating jewish people or muslim people there is no clause in the first amendment elsewhere in the us constitution or anywhere in us laws that outlaws drawings of moses criticism of judaism or judaic blasphemy or even insulting jewish people so islam and judaism jews and muslims not to mention christianity and christians are already treated equally under the law even if the congress passed law outlawing insulting of any prophet or their teachings it would not survive first contact with judicial review the best way for the muslim world to reduce insults of their prophet pebuh and his teachings would be to contain and marginalize the tantrum-prone among them who provoke such insults by demanding that we not utter them or else and who sometimes have violent tantrums when we quite predictably do it anyway telling you wise man you be happier and less frightened living in the uk where non-muslims can be arrested for islamic blasphemy such as harmlessly defacing koran or for publicly quoting winston churchill blunt and still apt assessment of islam pam geller isn even allowed to go there	0
rabbis and christian priests have been convicted of pedophilia yes they have the only places where middle-aged pedophiles don need to worry about running afoul of the law are some muslim countries like saudi arabia where it is still legal for them to marry and molest tiny little girls because of the depraved example of the barbarian warlord mohammed eternal shame be upon him what is your point my point in posting the link to mohammed baby portrait was light humor which you are too busy trembling in fear of muslims to appreciate you pathetic muslimophobe my point in referring to him as pedophile is that he was one and that needs to be said as long as anybody still views his life as exemplary despite his vile biogted teachings and his many atrocities	0
you are one deceitful poster who likes to bend reality do you doubt the reality of what explained to you about blasphemy laws congress and the scotus perhaps you should seek out religious leaders from judaism christianity buddhism hinduism shintoism confucianism as well as non religious leaders if you are unable to comprehend the weakness of your position sorry but as an atheist can imagine seeking out people who believe in gods and souls and such to assess the strength of my position with regard to insults of dead prophet we already have laws regarding antisemitism not in the us we don penalties for actual crimes can be enhanced if it is determined that they were motivated by ethnic hatred but there has to be an actual crime to begin with drawing picture of moses isn crime anywhere in the us just as drawing picture of the barbarian warlord mohammed pebuh isn believe your problem is that you hate all muslims both the good and the bad you have no basis for that belief and you resort to claiming to believe it only because you lack cogent arguments you must understand that their are billion muslims do understand it and understand that you are frightened that they will turn en masse into jihadi tantrum-throwers if they see insults of islam inventor am not frightened it very clear to me which one of us here is the muslimophobe find your alleged belief that hate all muslims offensive so dedicating this link to picture of piss mohammed to you it funny how you claimed that my insulting mohammed pebuh here endangers innocent lives yet you keep provoking me to do it more	0
judging from link posted below it seems that hillafart campaign staffers are abused like orphans in dickens novel she will eventually have to answer for her tyranny	1
hillafart is old fat retarded cow	1
this will be hillafart model free speech and guns for the rich and powerful you serf can poke each other with pitchforks in the mud	1
im not going to vote for candidate think is going to harm the country just because the other candidate is worse if clinton wanted those bernitdown votes then she should have earned them instead of responding trump trump trump trump to everything and ignoring the criticism	0
mean get why establishment democrats are calling for him to exit it allows clinton to pivot to trump full time but realistically provided he doesn decide to bernitdown and take clinton with him don see any problem with him staying in the race think sanders is positive force for the future of the democratic party even if think he the wrong choice for president	0
bernitdown	0
actually it younger women that are the ultra feminists from what have seen on all the bernie facebook pages it the mature lifelong liberal democratic women that are fucking pissed like bernitdown pissed	0
bernitdown	0
posted along the same lines in the sanders thread bernitdown	0
what does the bernitdown movement expect to happen with protest votes genuinely curious let say that the incredibly hypothetical result is bernie clinton and trump what has the movement achieved there still going to be new president it not like they re going to do re-vote	0
find this interesting as well voting for trump after supporting sanders tells me that these people don actually believe in sanders platform they feel insulated from the process as if electing trump will mean nothing bernitdown is the stupidest thing ive ever seen as if they can say fuck it with consequences not how life works	0
protesters angry left wing protesters kids who just had been ripped off for hundreds of dollars that they donated to bernie what waste the dnc was never going to give bernie the nomination you all know that now the dnc and hillary have wasted your time and your money fuck democracy right its her turn philly bernitdown	0
edit also the wikileaks emails showing how the dnc chairwoman dws amongst others were actively working against bernie despite the impartiality that was expected of them angered not insignificant portion of bernie supporters furthermore there was also the fact that despite dws resignation in light of these leaks she was still picked up by the clinton campaign and given job with them this is pure cronyism on the part of clinton and also clear breach of ethics on the part of the dnc this alienated bernie supporters much more than you could possibly imagine especially when they were being derided by some clinton supporters after bernie lost had clinton run fair campaign she probably would have retained more votes and the bernieorbust and bernitdown movements wouldn have gained much ground	0
bernie knows that he lost unlike the bernitdown crowd he knows that hillary will win the nomination and that hillary is infinitely better than trump people think that he ll use this debate as chance to attack hillary when in fact he ll attack the regressive policies of the republicans as whole as much as reddit hates on hillary they re isolated in bubble right now and this debate will do nothing but open eyes to what horrible candidate trump is bernie at the end of the day is pragmatist and knows that trump win means loss for everyone else on the planet it the last thing he wants he ll bury trump	0
thanks bernitdown	0
gt this was only controversy in the russian infested far left bernitdown communities	0
not even sure how to respond to that live in michigan and talked to lot of people last year about the potus race it was topic that definitely reached beyond far left bernitdown communities	0
the clinton illuminati has finally gotten to him it up to the berniebros to bernitdown and preserve the revolution they re the only ones left who haven been co-opted	0
don understand these users like yourself with those names like captainbernie or bernitdown and bern whatever spending the whole day saying negative things about bernie sanders think it like trump would say sad and waste of time	0
yes yes clinton is elite corporate shill bernitdown	0
the republicans must have loved the well if bernie can win then fuck it not going to vote bernitdown crowd	0
again voted for clinton so don know why you re coming at me with that bernitdown nonsense	0
there will still be plenty of redditarchists who want to bernitdown but think they ll be small number	0
which is my entire point which was addressed to the bernitdown and bernieorbust contingent aka the bros if you want to actually start political revolution you have to actually do something	0
so then you wouldn be considered bernitdown holdout as real fucking person not shill thank you for doing your part to save this country from the uniquely terrible danger that is donald trump	0
ll admit still want to bernitdown hillary will do nothing to fix issues plaguing the average american and will only serve to strengthen corporate influence over this country	0
because anyone who supported bernie but is planning to vote for trump in the general because neverhillary despite the fact that sanders and trump are nearly as opposite on policy positions as you can get clearly doesn have any real principles if it about sticking it to the establishment and bernitdown then you re goddamn child who needs to grow the hell up	0
throwing out the politics word of the day and giving no substance while making this trite bullshit argument about how there no point in differentiating between the two so fuck voting or bernitdown or whatever is the stupidest shit on the internet	0
bernitdown	0
this isn victory she is preparing for cabinet position if clinton wins bernitdown	0
at this point the bernitdown holdouts aren going to change their mind they don care about what he has to say or whats at stake	0
think bernitdown will be thing if the nomination goes against bernie and can say that think it will be completely unjustified	0
bernitdown	0
unlike the bernitdown crowd he smart and pragmatic man that knows you can always get of what you want and getting of what you want is better than	0
probably the biggest issue for me was that bernitdown clearly wouldn work the idea is that if clinton loses to such ludicrously weak opponent it sends loud and clear message to the dnc that they need the progressive wing of the party to win the presidency	0
lot of people just don quite fathom how deep seated the hatred for hillary runs just like the nevertrumps bernitdown was thing	0
considering may bernie supporters are all bernitdown guessing they do not sow	0
bernitdown is working this is what people all over this sub wanted during the primary general back when breitbart was considering reliable enough to put on the front page totes not propaganda	0
ted cruz gave millions to carly fiorina presidential campaign and fiorrino then endorced cruz carly has cruz mistress on her payroll ted cruz john edwards gary hart only this time the gope is protecting sell out lying ted cruz ted cruz mistress crisis on carly payroll which cruz funded why did ted cruz pac give half million to carly fiorina	0
the fix is in paul ryan as speaker and bush or rubio carly fiorino why paul ryan will be speaker majority leader eric cantor loss and the origin of paul ryan as speaker how the gop will ensure trump cruz will never be nominated only rinos how the elites plan on getting jeb bush or rubio fiorrino into the white house why did now gop people run for president if know cannot win answer splinter the conservative vote rnc gope rule changes and how they impact the presidential primary to get rino elected cold anger action alert rnc gope changing delegate distribution rules if you were wondering why brett baier and megan kelly did all they could to kneecap trump last night maybe this news will help to explain it newscorp has donated more than million to clinton family accounts	0
tell that to carly fiorrino she mocked barbara boxer looks and just called trump putin and had her surrogate talk about his balls and then carly plays the gender card when words are slung back at her and she runs and hides behind fox news skirt and they protect her carly is disgusting hypocrite	0
trump was great on fallon and on colbert cruz was awful on colbert never bothered watching fiorrino	0
cruz is for huge massive visa program and was for illegal amnesty and his wife is gold sachs executive pluse cruz donated campaign funds to carly fiorina who the female equivalent of jeb bush marco rubio which seriously made me question what the hell is wrong with cruz for donating money to fiorrino am only voting for people trump or cruz or paul absolutely will not for for any other republican candidate and will write in name or vote rd party if one of these men are not the candidate none of the are perfect but trump is not owned by anyone like cruz and paul and the rest are and does not dance to their tune trust trump on the border and don trust cruz or paul on that disagree with any private company getting any subsidy and disagree with trump on that and imminent domain but he is still better than all the candidates who are rino with the exception of cruz and paul carson would never vote for because his best friend and campaign spokesman armstrong williams wrote articles in that taxpayers should fund nation of islam carson lost all credibility after that	0
what you wrote does not make sense what does palin have to do with anything what does bush have to do with how someone feels about fiorino also it is liberals who have palin bush syndrome not conservatives who don support liberal carly fiorrino who should be vp on hillary ticket	0
carson stated obama is not muslim do most christians and jews usually choose muslim first and second name fiorrino idolizes the ottoman suleiman sunni muslim empire as historys greatest empire the republican party is mine field full of rinos trump	0
yet another reason to vote for donald trump he did not need to run and the elites are trashing him for daring to help the little people what did the other candidates give up nothing rubio was never anything but politcian in fl then in wa dc he is lawyer who never practiced law and will get good jub as lobbyist bush didn give up damn thing whatever good things he said he should be doing instead of running for president he should drop out and do it huckabee fox is keeping his slot open for this fat rino to get his show back chrsitie didn give up damn thing he is not popular nj gov and if nj boots him out as gov and he definitely won be nominee he will go back to being lawyer which is what he did prior to running for office he was government prosecutor fiorrino she gave up nothing she can live off her hp fired golden parachute until she dies no one will hire her worthless self to run anything would not put it past this skant to be lobbyist like rubio will likely end up being the rest- you get the picture	0
women are patriots and not media-generated victims of sexism comment of opposition to an opponent who happens to be women is not sexist calling trump carnival clown is not sexist calling senator cruz jack-ass is not racist do want fiorrino to be the face of america the republican party absolutely not but saying that is not sexist it is very simply choosing not to support candidate that favors amnesty and who allies with the vichy republlcans and has done so since she was fired by hp	0
flocks newz and establishment gop borrowed page taken from the left war on women megyn kelly maddow was chosen as woman to bait donald trump then carly fiorino would attack him for his war on women to raise her own poll numbers the people saw right through megyn maddow and sandra flake fiorrino fake war on women act against donald trump	0
flocks newz and establishment gop borrowed page taken from the left war on women megyn kelly maddow was chosen as woman to bait donald trump then carly fiorino would attack him for his war on women to raise her own poll numbers the people saw right through megyn maddow and sandra flake fiorrino fake war on women act against donald trump	0
cruz should be asked to say it to donald face like they did with donald to fiorrino	0
get ready folks the media is fixing to shove fiorrino down the throats of the electorate in the first hour of morning news ve heard that she won the debate at least dozen times of course her strategy of not talking to putin while rattling the american saber would end up starting nuclear war but who cares we need an imbecile in office	0
stop spreading lies you are smear merchant and speaking of liars just saw rino rove on fox shilling for the gope as usual rove actually had the cognitive dissonance to say with straight face that trump has low ceiling and one of the other candidates like rubio kasich or fiorrino could still surge and take out trump hahaha dreaming again karl go trump	0
fiorrino and carson the republican hilary and the pediatrician the business of america is about getting back to business and making historical positive leaps forward long live the american businesses and companies	0
would not ever watch the view can not stand the hosts but don like fiorrino either	0
personally think an ordoliberal model more like germany is superior approach thanks to advances in economic and data sciences allowing for better active optimization of the market by state action but that neither here nor there	0
there the whole idea that markets are energy particularly enjoy the ordoliberal strain of thought that was cousin to the nascent neoliberalism of friedman it not illiberal to expect regulation and rules to govern that energy	0
scandinavia isn socialist they re ordoliberal at most	0
tbh had not heard the word ordoliberal before even though am quite enamored with the german social system it is beautiful world when learn new things thanks	0
coming from montana it has always been constant struggle dealing with conservatism honestly fall in the more ordoliberal category flathead county where from is the most consecutively conservative voting county in the	0
they aren the ordoliberal centrists who dominated the party until the rise of goldwater and they aren the liberal consevatives who dominated the party until the great depression but the national conservatives of the republican party are still conservatives and they are the most predominant form of conservatives in modern america this can be pushed away as those other people this is on the conservative movements which fostered this authoritarianism aside from some right-libertarians if they can even be called conservative all major conservative movements in america are complicit	0
that sounds like clinton obama to me neoliberalism is fairly big tent and doesn preclude support for social safety net ve got strong ordoliberal leanings myself but it boggles my mind how sane people dance around the term liberal and come up with convoluted ways to describe perfectly conventional viewpoints no offense	0
gt ordoliberal theory holds that the state must create proper legal environment for the economy and maintain healthy level of competition through measures that adhere to market principles the concern is that if the state does not take active measures to foster competition firms with monopoly or oligopoly power will emerge which will not only subvert the advantages offered by the market economy but also possibly undermine good government since strong economic power can be transformed into political power	0
no thanks ll take normal ordoliberal in the german or nordic model instead	0
that me to great to find group of like-minded folks had to look up ordoliberal thanks for introducing me to new term here the definition if anyone else is curious	0
where can read more about this this is the first time ve heard the term ordoliberal	0
germany is capitalistic albeit ordoliberal with welfare state	0
no he doesn at least he doesn in public he might very well do in private and know he be completely unelectable if he does he repeatedly said that he wants to keep capitalism around and just tame it which is fine by me but that makes him social democrat or even more specifically and ordoliberal	0
yes of course governments can be inefficient but that something everybody who subscribes to any form of mixed economy would affirm no matter if social democrat ordoliberal or whatever	0
for me personally though want democratic candidate wholly committed to destroying the neoliberal overton window on economics and returning to fdr keynsian ordoliberal style economics want someone who will go to corporations who are oligopolies or monopolies and break them up if they are not natural or regulate them to behave as if they were perfectly competitive markets if they are natural want someone who will break up banks who are too big to fail and encourage local perfectly competitive markets over massive corporations and want someone who will commit to limiting all people and legal entities to of political donations per year by amendment if neccessary	0
european anti-trust law is dramatically different than us law in the us our laws are based on the end of the and the emphasis on stopping monopolies eu anti-trust law grows out of the german ordoliberal school of thought so there less concern with monopolies and more of concern with abuse of dominant position google didn have true monopoly since things like yahoo and bing exist but they unquestionably have dominant market position and they were using it to further entrench their own profit potential in the us very skeptical that they be fined under the same facts of the case	0
guess technically an ordoliberal	0
so unless bernie and trump want to debate on trutv or the nature channel this isn happening	0

the regulators called for the divestment of turner broadcasting by time warner not just cnn warner primary branches are hbo warner bros and turner broadcasting turner broadcasting including cnn counts cartoon network tbs tnt trutv and ton of other broadcasting entities in over countries among its portfolio	0
he had whole terrible show about it on trutv conspiracy theory with jesse ventura all about weather control and shit	0
dont see the trap here the people that are buying into the rhetoric that cnn is fake news and radical left biased are not going to fact check whether cnn actually cut away or turned their cameras off they are going to take trump word they are not the target audience for their news programming now the glitch here is that they are likely part of the target demographic for other turner broadcasting system offerings including tbs tnt turner classic movies cartoon network adult swim boomerang at amp sportsnet and trutv	0
yeah he literally hosted show on trutv called conspiracy theory with jesse ventura it was hilarious secret meetings under bridges with alex jones and everything	0
you re kind of right courttv was cancelled but in session was on the trutv channel in the mornings covering court trials until noon maybe then hln would pick it up after that for the big trials like casey anthony and jodi arias	0
constantly think that we ve become passivized violence is bad civil unrest is not civil what on trutv tonight	0
you re an idiot nothing leaked about watergate president resigned rather than face charges truly scandalous things have already come out of the mueller investigation federal investigations take time it not snap your fingers and we re done like go watch trutv or something since you fundamentally even at the lowest level dont get how investigations work	0
use this reputation to establish trumptv with some dumb name like trutv	0
this debate should have been aired exclusively on trutv and sandwiched between impractical jokers reruns	0

rejected knowledge will also reject thee that thou shalt be no priest to me seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy god will also forget thy children hosea we just jad the greatest rape of oiur children in history ever muslims selling abducting violating our children just as their prophet teaches and trump cannot call muhamad pedophile but instead says muslims who agree he is the perfect example messenger of god teaching this are fabulous do we want our children to be slaughtered and slaves or free king james bible and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free john the first step to solving any problem is being honest ben is an honest man opposing evil and needing our support help him save not only his family but all ours as well not only the land he risked for but

jesus don call me trumpard voted hillary voted bernie in the primaries and absolutely loathe the man but of every news station in the country last night was covering the terrorist attacks in england to suggest that bombing killing people in england is run of the mill daily terror in another country is one of the most asinine things ive heard this was not media conspiracy the media was right for covering this last night over the russia story there wasn anything happening last night with that story that was anywhere near as big of story as the bombing at the concert in manchester	1
obviously the six degrees of kevin bacon is alive and well at the hill why don they also run that photo of tony rezko with hillary by the way the convicted democrat fundraiser just got out of federal prison this month without any mention in the state-run media like the obamas the clintons probably benefited more financially from that up close and personal association with rezko than any grassroots campaign contributor the liberal double-standard	0
in chicago she lived in house built by tony rezko look it up he in prison right now and check out the real estate deal tony gave the obamas in chicago	0
his real missing daddy replacements then became ultra radical freaks icons like alinsky and black liberation heroes he hates white people and his wife even more so though they live in house built by slaves well fed and lodged ask them about the house they lived in in chicago built by tony rezko frauds using the backs of slavery for their own personal gain all the while stealing along the way btw tony rezko is in prison he political hustler con man insider deal maker and real estate agent to others just like him	0

thanks for the information but what you are saying is less then truth most people have trouble with telling story about development and it difficult to fault them because it not their business and suspect it is not yours as well take for example this from conservative review soros gave donald trump mezzanine loan which is basically bailout because trump didn want to or couldn front his own money to build the chicago trump tower mezzanine loans are loans offered with outrageous interest that help the developer on the front end of finance and which often offer stake in the building mezzanine finance is not bailout and is used as form of finance every day it should be noted that soros was one of four lenders in the million mezzanine loan and the rest held by deutsche bank of germany your they are most likely all business partners in ownership is based on what information in mezzanine loan structure there are several ways to protect the lenders position not including ownership of stock deutsche bank of germany holds first position the other four mezzanine lenders are inferior as opposed to the first being superior meaning in default deutsche bank of germany would take back the property and the mezzanine lenders would only have what leverage they arranged with trump all of this is academic anyway because as of there is no financial difficulty and the jr financing has been paid down or is no longer factor am not an expert on trumps business but plus years in professional real estate tells me little about hit pieces and innuendo by people with an agenda suggest you understand the facts and players before making anymore judgements partnerships corporations mortgages defaults legal instruments and actions are matter of public record in the city of chicago and the state of illinois if you know how to where to look and understand what you are looking at then you will have much of the facts shell corporations foreign holdings and the like require more work and investigation been there and done that if you wish to practice then do so with obama residence in chicago and the vacant lot adjoining it owned by convicted corruption charged tony rezko that will sharpen your skills the chicago press never got that one straight know because worked it in if you want the facts you must understand the business and as said at the beginning most people don understand it	0

corruption of this sort is old hat for obama as evidenced by the following it goes on and on with too many instances to list here but here is link to the timeline focus f-news posts excerpts from the timeline of obama life for three years obama is the director of the developing communities project dcp part of the gamaliel foundation another alinsky-like group which uses in your face tactics threats against banks to obtain more loans to people in poor neighborhoods gamaliel co-founder executive director is gregory galluzzo who served as trainer mentor during obama community activist days in chicago harvard letter of recommendation for obama is also written by john mcknight who serves on the gamaliel foundation board of directors as well as the board of national people action npa another group of alinsky-inspired agitators that pickets homes of business leaders politicians the npa consists of alinskyite thugs agitators who when picketing the homes of business government leaders to demand more benefits hand-outs sing who on your hit list npa who on your hit list of today take no prisoner take no names kick em in the ass when they play their games one of obama tasks at acorn where he works with madeline talbott is training community activists how to use direct action be more forceful in demanding change the in your face style is preached by obama used by activists to stage sit-ins demonstrations at banks to garner publicity support for more bank loans for unqualified poor people acorn stages two-day sit-in at the house banking committee room in tactics include picketing at the homes of bank executives calling them racists for not lending to the poor among the banks targeted is chicago bell federal savings which no longer exists the chicago tribune in september of referred to the acorn agenda as affirmative action lending critics later refer to those types of loans as ninja loans no income no job no assets in obama sues the state of illinois on behalf of acorn to get the state to comply with the federal motor voter law law which republican governor jim edgar correctly argues will invite voter fraud partly because government officers registering new voters are under orders not to ask anyone for identification or proof of citizenship acorn has been prominent in the fight against photo for voting other means of voter identification acorn specifically sought out obama to represent them in the lawsuit it was not simply assigned to him by law firm in urged by obama the woods fund gives more money to community organizer groups like acorn the woods fund publicly lies about its ideology which allows it to obtain donations from many who aren aware of its radical intentions obama committee own report even brags that its claim to be non-ideological has enabled the trustees to make grants to organizations that use confrontational tactics against the business government establishments without undue risk of being criticized of partisanship during obama tenure with the woods fund the organization gives out more than to acorn in october of obama attends the male-only million man march organized by nation of islam leader louis farrakhan until obama serves with william ayers on the board of the woods fund liberal chicago non-profit organization grants from the fund are given out to reverend james meeks fiery anti-white anti-semitic chicago preacher in the style of obama reverend jeremiah wright father michael pfleger perhaps best known encouraging his parishioners to buy time from prostitutes as way of inviting the women to counseling job training the woods fund also gives money to acorn which registers voters in poor black neighborhoods to garner additional support for obama arguably these actions by obama acorn are illegal because as an allegedly independent apolitical tax-exempt non-profit group acorn cannot legally pimp for obama but that is essentially what it does in registering voters while drumming up support for the candidate who is financing its operations its tax-exempt status is thus flagrantly violated by acorn in obama gives radio interview to chicago station wbez-fm in which he discusses the redistribution of wealth from whites to blacks obama remarks one of the think the tragedies of the civil rights movement was because the civil rights movement became so court-focused think there was tendency to lose track of the political community organizing activities on the ground that are able to put together the actual coalitions of power through which you bring about redistributive change and uh in some ways we still suffer from that he continued not optimistic about bringing about major redistributive change through the courts the institution just isn structured that way obama is not opposed to the redistribution of wealth he merely feels the courts shouldn be the institution forcing it you can craft theoretical justifications for it legally after fox news broadcasts the interview in october of the obama campaign cries foul charging fox with creating fake news controversy obama in illegally uses state funds for political mailing obama pushes legislation in the illinois senate sb to reduce the number of members of the health facilities planning board from to with the help of tony rezko stuart levine governor rod blogojevich gets three of his campaign

proposing an amendment to the constitution authorizing congress to prohibit the desecration of the united states flag during his kenya visit obama makes speech to university students in nairobi in

atleast this latest event reveals the democratic party for the anti-semitic scumbags ve always taken them for cats out of the bag and it muslim sympathizing jew hating cat named barry hussein soetoro obama and valerie jarrett published at pm new york the recently discovered newspaper article by vernon jarrett the father-in-law of senior white house adviser valerie jarrett opens new dimension to understanding obama youth as vernon jarrett was close friend of obama communist party-activist mentor frank marshall davis the connections were not lost on joel gilbert the filmmaker whose documentary dreams from my real father argues davis card-carrying member of the communist party usa was the biological as well as ideological father of barack obama not the kenyan who came to the university of hawaii in the nov column by vernon jarrett in the st petersburg independent was unearthed by frank miele editor of the daily inter lake in kalispell mont joel gilbert dreams from my real father is available at wnd superstore in the column which originally appeared in the chicago tribune nov jarrett reported proposal by islamic radical and former black panther khalid abdullah tariq al-monsour the lawyer previously known as donald warden to work on behalf of saudi arabia and opec to provide million for years to aid minority students each year davis and vernon jarrett were close friends in chicago and colleagues at the chicago defender and the chicago star two communist-run newspapers in the in early davis and jarrett served together on the publicity committee of the citizen committee to aid packing-house workers communist-organized labor union that represented workers in the meatpacking industry very possibly vernon jarrett path crossed that of frank marshall davis when barack obama frank marshall davis son needed financing to attend harvard gilbert said remarkably he continued obama was in chicago at the time and jarrett was on the scene to find politically favorable funding from former black panther turned black muslim in the person of khalid al-monsour who had convenient relationship with one of the richest men in the world saudi prince al-waleed bin talal gilbert carried the relationships full circle as former colleague of davis in chicago he said jarrett had reason to want to connect obama with al-mansour funding program but it doesn end there gilbert continued very possibly jarrett helped finance frank son possibly explaining why obama would later return to use the connection once again when he sought to get his wife michelle obama hired into chicago mayor harold washington office by none other than valerie jarrett daughter-in-law of vernon jarrett gilbert noted the article also sheds light on the claim that veteran new york power broker and well-known attorney percy sutton intervened at the request of al-mansour to write letter of recommendation to get obama into harvard law school all it would have taken was for vernon jarrett to introduce obama the son of frank marshall davis to al-monsour gilbert continued as was reported in sutton then an octogenarian explained on the new york-produced inside city hall television show that al-monsour brought obama to his attention sutton said al-mansour told him about obama in letter there young man that has applied to harvard know that you have few friends left there because you used to go up there to speak would you please write letter in support of him gilbert said al-monsour might have known he could fund obama through the saudi prince but first obama had to get accepted into harvard law school for the plan to work al-monsour realized sutton had the necessary connections to make his recommendation credible to the harvard law school admittance committee gilbert said gilbert also noted the article explains why obama was so well accepted in the chicago-based muslim community including by pro-palestinian professor rashid khalidi and syrian-born democratic fundraiser tony rezko who is now serving prison sentence for fraud and bribery rezko and his many arab-american partners funded obama political campaigns his state senate races his failed congressional race and his senate campaign gilbert explained it appears obama academic career funders handed him off to rezko arab network to advance obama political career to what ends gilbert wondered if financial indebtedness to the saudis might explain why obama was so deferential as to bow to the saudi king upon meeting him for the first time at the meeting in london in what did the arab funders expect in return from obama in return for the academic and political funding gilbert asked is barack obama and the united states itself subject to blackmail revealing the source of his academic funding from those arab funders if he does not follow their wishes gilbert continued speculating does the jarrett-al-monsour connection dating from the time obama went to harvard explain why obama has conducted an open-door policy for the muslim brotherhood to penetrate the white house the state department and even the military how about obama hostility toward israel and prime minister netanyahu maybe the roots

hamilton submitted draft of art that only stated citizen not natural born citizen let look at the intent which if we examine it logically is clear let pretend bin laden lived here in his youth that he secretly had son who was born by an american women who converted to islam and views sharia law as required under god to rule all peoples she sends her citizen son off to live for years with bin laden so he can be properly indoctrinated mid eastern muslim money funds brilliant education for him he goes to harvard is the favored student his history is covered up and rewritten much as obama has been he gets elected to office and is involved in civil rights actions concerning muslim discrimination but in the new reform america time comes when people want to end the conflict between the west and mecca the young cloaked bin laden who goes by the name james gentry his mother last name gains enough traction though his rhetoric to gain international backing to run for president the capitals of islam fund campaign using secret funding to make sure mr gentry is the best funded and has the best chance of winning he wins he now is the commander in chief of the american army this is why natural born was inserted into art to insure child is born to parents completely loyal to the constitution as best as can be anticipated obama has very cloaked past he was barry up until the book dreams of my father was written book written admittedly by bill ayres the plan was to africanize him to better attract south side chicago voters before running him for mayor he ran for state senate instead using the machine lawyers to be the sole name on the ballot in the the community where he organized voters he consorted with rezko baathist front man for foreign influence in illinois rezko was funded by nadhmi auchi another baathist who ran saddam oil ministry in iraq it was the receipt of million dollars from auchi while under bond release that landed rezko in jail for good when federal judge discovered it in jan of part of that money was used to buy lot next to obama chicago house which was required to be bought with his house rezko wife signed for that lot auchi money was involved in paying for it so this potus went to person under indictment for criminal fraud violation for buying politicians and asked for help to buy house in an interview with famed muslim civil right lawyer percy sutton it was asked if he knew obama in april of percy beamed he said he was asked by khalid al mansour to help him by writing letters of recommendation for obama to the admission office at harvard where he had lectured many times he also stated that al mansour was raising money for obama to go to harvard he talked about prince alweed bin talal as funding source the video is easily fund on youtube recommend it al mansour was born in houston his birth name was donald warden he was major member of the ayres weather underground he hid bill and bernadine for several years in sf after they bombed the house of federal judge in think we elected man with friends like this to be potus had art been enforced this would never have happened his mixed loyalties and sympathies would have eliminated him from consideration the road map to usurp was paved by this breach next time it could be much bigger threat to all of us if you are cruz supporter its not an attack on him or his credibility it is the one stop gap we have for helping insure we don end up with usurper in office who could in few days cause massive damage down load all security files to enemies order troops to stand down in the face of great danger to the country etc what are we supposed to do impeach the guy how long does that take hope the threat presented by this silly idea that only one parent will do is little more clear we can be allowing children of foreign enemies to have access to the nuclear button	0

bill-kristol would- have done better to have been this worried when obozo was running for the-office instead he all smoked-up about the replacement contenders no one today much worries that in the campaign obama smeared the working classes of pennsylvania revved up his supporters in philadelphia folks in philly like good brawl to bring their guns to knife fight and urged others to get in their face and quite unapologetically lied about his supposedly sporadic presence in front of reverend wright racist and anti-semitic pulpit after earlier bragging in chicago newspaper interview about his perfect attendance few cared about the felon tony rezko sweetheart discounted sale of backyard real estate to the obamas an academic downscaled version of something like trump steaks if anyone knows of another case of an obscure underdog senate candidate suddenly surging ahead of first his favored primary opponent and later his favored general-election opponent after both had the details of their sealed divorce and custody records mysteriously leaked please cite parallel when obama later was forced to admit that his autobiographical memoir was mostly fiction or when bill clinton was revealed to have jetted around with convicted sex abuser jeffrey epstein or when obama invites as an honored white house guest rapper whose latest album cover glorifies homies on the white house lawn gloating over the corpse of white judge at their feet think we long ago eroded any notion of presidential decorum the honest and quite legitimate argument against trump on this count is the one we never hear that instead of offering corrective to the present crudity he might continue to erode the dignity of the office in the manner of bill and hillary clinton and barack obama even trump however could hardly do more damage with the iranians than did obama in-house wannabe novelist ben rhodes who in the twilight of his one and only policy career now brags how he misled the congress and the public by easily salting the media field with phony nuggets of expertise and punditry the point is that we are worried about armageddon on the trump horizon while we are living amid the apocalypse so the issue for conservatives in november is twofold one would trump presidency represent new ethical and cultural low that is would he say and do things far beyond what we have come to contextualize and excuse from the clintons or barack obama trump or clinton hobson choice by victor david hansen may	0

ohbama is an enduring enigma paradox stinky pos his arrogance narcissism is not supported by any real skill accomplishment or talent his ticket to stardom was is his skin color in that the liberal crowd saw the opportunity to get under him and lift him into the white house they were successful due to convergence of circumstances his syrian connection in chicago rezko and the timing of having weak candidate in hillary the irony is that he believes he has the midas touch when in fact it the exact opposite everything he touches turns to doo doo the fundamental question one must ask is am better off today versus before ohbama became president the only answer is no	0

obama term as board chair of the chicago annenberg challenge in the mid- where he and his colleague unrepentant terrorist william ayers misused over million in private donations meant to improve the

purchase of diploma from columbia university obama tries to explain his absence from columbia by saying lived like hermit in truth there is not one credible trace of him actually having attended classes there let alone of him having lived anywhere near the campus there is greater weight of evidence that he was actually in pakistan at the behest of zbigniew brzezhinski who is professor there millions in illegal contributions accepted by the obama campaign during his presidential run credit card filters designed to screen out foreign money and domestic donors who had maxed out their legally allowable limits as required by us law were intentionally switched off secretary of state hillary clinton ongoing effort to create international small arms accords that will subvert the second

timber obama month long stint as un security council chair in the first ever by sitting president in clear violation of constitutional law not only did this action give credibility to an international organization ruled by tyrants it also called into question potential dual loyalties by our president the obama national security strategy released in may that allows for the targeted assassination of us citizens including homegrown terrorists without due process it has also been described by the kremlin which knows quite lot about these kinds of things as new law put forth by president obama

without oversight by congress the courts fbi or local law enforcement deployment of national guard troops to border states where they will not under any circumstances be used to stop the flow of

embracement of our enemies treason the state department using million in taxpayer money to help transform kenya into constitutionally communist nation where the freedom of speech is limited and private property rights are subservient to social justice in addition the recently adopted kenyan constitution allows for the practice of sharia law in some regions ensuring women will not be guaranteed basic human rights conducting independent foreign policy and diplomacy as senator without sanction and in violation of existing law barack obama misused millions in taxpayer money on bogus fact finding missions to aid his muslim supremacist cousin raila odinga in his election bid in kenya instigating violent overthrow of religiously tolerant friendly democratic government in kenya according to intercepted emails barack obama was directing his cousin raila odinga to use violence and intimidation if he could not democratically take power in kenya death and bloodshed followed helping to shelter terrorists wanted by the barack obama apparently was aware that in helping his cousin raila odinga to take power in kenya he was helping to establish terrorist safe haven as required by odinga secret agreement with islamic factions according to law this makes barack obama himself an enemy of the by working to give aid and protection to terrorists see definition of treason at end of list obama refusal to hold press conferences and answer difficult questions as expected of us president never in the modern age has there been president so unwilling to answer to the american people for his actions considering the public growing anger towards his progressive policies it is doubtful obama will ever hold another press conference again the billion bailout of the teacher unions that obama recently signed into law not only was the money taken from food stamp programs for poor americans in order to fund democrat special interests portion will be skimmed off the top as union dues and tunneled to democrat political campaigns this fall obama involvement with governor rod blagojevich attempt to sell his old illinois senate seat even if obama didn try to purchase the position for his chosen replacement slumlord valerie jarrett at the very least he had to know the seat was for sale department of interior secretary ken salazar plans to take control of millions of acres of public and private land in western states by designating them national monuments these efforts are being carried out in secret and without input from congress state and local officials and current land owners obama use of taxpayer money to pay for democrat propaganda including million for the american reinvestment and recovery act road signs and million for the perpetually misleading website the lasting damage obama has done to the jewish people in his less than two years in office there has been an outpouring of hatred towards the jews the likes of which thought would never live to see from helen thomas telling the jews to get the hell out of palestine to heavily armed terrorist flotillas destined for the gaza strip described as peaceful by the western press from throwing stones at little old ladies leaving synagogue in sweden to the thousands of jewish families fleeing muslim persecution in france sea change in world public opinion against the jewish people has been accomplished during obama term because of his refusal to speak out against virulent anti-semitism being pushed by left-wing politicians and islamists around the world the harm to the jewish people will surely outlive his presidency and could have terrible unforeseen consequences convicted felon and chicago real estate developer tony rezko purchase of land adjacent to obama house in hyde park il in rezko sold foot strip of his property to obama for rendering the remainder of rezko investment too small to be developed and for all intents and purposes worthless lying on his illinois state bar application barack obama knowingly omitted information about his previous identities barry soetoro etc when applying for membership as lawyer in the state bar association identity theft and fraud barack obama is using connecticut social security number ssn in official documents it obviously does not belong to him legally it also appears he has used wide array of other ssns in the past also fraudulently falsification of selective service registration document examiners have found obvious fraud and tampering in barack obama registration for selective service which was evidently perpetrated in order to make the document appear that it had been filed many years before it actually was for political purposes lying about which hospital he was born in in an attempted coverup over the controversy about his actual birthplace barack obama has laid claim to being born at two different hospitals in fact neither hospital has any record of obama or his mother ever having been registered in them as patient or any of the hospitals in hawaii the provision of obama campaign donor lists to acorn in and more complete than the ones he gave to the federal elections comission acorn used the lists to raise money for obama election from donors who had already maxed out their legally allowable contributions circumventing an official travel ban to pakistan by his own admission obama knowingly violated the then existing travel ban to pakistan by residents he evidently did this by using foreign passport illegal use of casual hypnosis techniques experts on the use of hypnosis are in agreement that barack obama received training and then made use of hypnosis methods during his campaign this was to deliberately circumvent rational or critical thinking in masses of people such methods are well known and also illegal widespread voter fraud including voter intimidation ballot stuffing falsified documents and threats of violence against hillary clinton supporters committed by the obama campaign and acorn during the democrat primary election for more information see my cfp article how obama used an army of thugs to steal the democratic party nomination obama refusal to release his long form birth certificate which would show conclusively that he is dual citizen and therefore not constitutionally eligible to serve as president obama college records which have also not been released would also contain information regarding his dual citizenship status protecting union interests over those of gm and chrysler bond holders during bankruptcy proceedings forcing investors to accept millions of dollars in losses in direct violation of bankruptcy laws money to which they were legally entitled preferential treatment given to minority and women owned car dealerships by obama administration officials as part of the auto industry bailout program and the forced closing of disproportionate number of dealerships located in rural areas that did not vote for obama unsubstantiated firing of corporation for national and community service inspector general gerald walpin for exposing sacramento mayor and obama supporter kevin johnson misuse of an americorps grant purchase of congressional support bribery for the passage of obama healthcare bill including the cornhusker kickback louisiana purchase and having the department of interior increase water allocations to the central valley of california to secure the votes of democrat reps dennis cardoza and jim costa lying to the american people by promising they could keep their healthcare coverage if they wanted to when in reality tens of millions will be forced out of their current plans attempted bribery of rep joe sestak with job offers to get him to drop out of the senate primary race against senator arlen specter directing the epa to unilaterally set carbon emission standards thus unconstitutionally bypassing congress which opposed obama energy reform bill for more information see my cfp article forget cap and trade epa regulation of cq emissions will begin in months the obama administration statement lie that panel of experts had agreed with their plan for month gulf coast drilling moratorium when in actuality none of them had supported the measure bullying bp to set up billion slush fund to compensate gulf coast businesses and residents affected by the oil spill to be administered by an obama political appointee without any judicial or congressional oversight implementing third oil-drilling moratorium after the first two were thrown out of court creating de facto gulf coast offshore drilling ban in opposition to two judge rulings obama policy of intentionally not securing our nation borders in opposition to article iv section of the constitution which calls for the president to protect states from foreign invasion in an attempt to blackmail republican support for comprehensive immigration reform in essence obama is holding border states and residents politically hostage during time they are being overrun by narco-paramilitary invasion department of justice illegal race based policies regarding voter fraud as exposed by former justice attorney christian adams this includes the dropping of voter intimidation charges against black panthers brandishing weapons in front of voting location in philadelphia and the stated intention by political appointees to ignore voter crimes committed by african americans latinos and other minorities department of justice purposefully allowing some states to continue their disenfranchisement of military personnel serving overseas in direct opposition to the military and overseas voter empowerment move act which was established in response to the more than military votes that were not counted in the election because ballots had arrived after the deadline recess appointment of donald berwick as head of the centers for medicare and medicaid services without even token attempt to put him through the congressional nomination process signaling that congress constitutional obligation to vet presidential appointees means nothing to obama the same can be said of the obama administration czars tampering with the supreme court after an active case concerning him had been filed barack obama held secret meeting with the supreme court almost immediately after being sworn in behind closed doors no one would reveal what had been discussed but shortly afterward the papers filed in the case challenging obama constitutional eligibility to hold presidential office mysteriously disappeared supreme court tampering part ii elena kagan barack obama appointee for supreme court justice had in fact been barack obama own attorney representing him in supreme court cases involving obama citizenship and constitutional eligibility for the presidency this is proven directly from the supreme court website there is still supreme court case pending for obama citizenship and eligibility to be president the senate allowed obama to stack the court in his own favor by their approval obama chose his own attorney and advocate to be his new judge this is perhaps the most extreme case of corruption and conflict of interest in history fraud and perjury in taking an oath of office the oath of office requires statement to defend the constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic barack obama himself is on tape as saying that the constitution is deeply flawed and an obstacle to his own political objectives taking the oath with purpose of evasion nullifies the oath it is also an open act of perjury on his part spending million of taxpayer money through the agency for international development usaid to support constitutional referendum in kenya in spite of the siljander amendment which makes it illegal for the to lobby for abortion in other countries the kenyan referendum was partially written by planned parenthood and is designed to legalize abortion in that nation the participation of the obama administration in the firing of sherry sherrod from the usda without due process because of publicized out of context remarks she made at naacp meeting in march the white house sham investigation of bp involvement in the release of the mass murdering lockerbie bomber from prison the obama administration not only knew beforehand of the scottish government plan to set abdel baset al-megrahi free on compassionate grounds they even sent letter to scottish authorities stating their preference for his remaining in scotland over his transfer to libyan prison the canceling of properly filed oil field development contracts approved by the bush administration by interior secretary ken salazar preventing the extraction of up to trillion gallons of oil buried under colorado utah wyoming and north dakota more than enough to end our dependence on foreign oil and supply the with its energy needs for hundreds of years at current consumption rates instigation of the universal slavery act hr- it is no exaggeration to say that this bill if enacted would force all citizens into involuntary servitude slavery in clear violation of the bill of rights and human decency amazingly barack obama would see this as the fulfillment of campaign promise investigations by the department of homeland security to determine the political affiliation of people making freedom of information act requests and the subsequent delay and even altogether ignoring of requests made by republican affiliated individuals loyalty to foreign sovereigns in violation of constitutional requirements not only does barack obama regularly fail to show allegiance to the flag but his bowing to leaders of foreign nations is an open and obvious show of fealty to them the constitution demands allegiance to the alone generational theft of trillions of taxpayer dollars thanks to obama theft of taxpayer money for bogus stimulus plans several generations will be indebted with tax burdens they can never repay making them slaves to the government the real purpose for this money seems to have been as colossal gift to large corporations in thanks for their political and financial support the hardest to prosecute in court but worst crime of all that obama has perpetrated against the american people is the economic tyranny his socialist policies have wrecked upon our nation while obama has been living the life of king including frequent star vacations dozens of concerts at the white house and endless rounds of golf all paid for by taxpayer money the increased transportation and security costs alone are in the millions of dollars he has called for the rest of us to endure economic sacrifice the annual trillion dollar deficits and borrowing of cents of every dollar of federal spending by obama is leading to unsustainable and potentially catastrophic national debt definition of treason united states code at states whoever owing allegiance to the united

last time checked righties had their own mediasphere to pound the old rev wright rezko ayers drum to no avail as was stated in the article the clintons relationship is their own business nor is it bizarre cons trying to re-litigate the do so at their peril face it obama won twice because he was the superior candidate to the gop nominee people in knew about wright rezko ayers looked at what conservatives had to offer and elected him anyway hillary too is superior to all candidates on the left and right dredging up year old scandals will put the gop in deeper hole than they re already in please proceed	0
using the truth trump will go there in return as we saw with wright ayers rezko and benghazi the dc media will attempt to make it blowback on him but as we have seen with everything else our lying media has attempted to cover up trump will not back down and that is the key to winning make your stand on the truth throw it in their faces and don back down not one inch	0
ayers wright khalidi rezko alinski various and sundry grifters radicals zealots marxists and lots and lots of jew-haters saw the totalitarian mindset very early on and his despotic lawless constitution-shredding reign is playing out pretty much as expected only worse	0
reminds me of the whitewater scam the tony rezko obama chicago land deal scam both the clintons and obamas cut shady deals and then tried to cover up the details and avoid public scrutiny mr trump is dealing with the problems associated with his business dealings through the courts unlike the clintons and obamas who used political corruption lies sleaze to cover up the truth	0
is the new yorker right-wing paper remember when they made cover with the fist bump and obama dressed jihadi garb anyway if obama spent maybe few months in that church wouldn have been bothered about it he spent years there listening to those inflammatory sermons secondly the first birthers were the clintons not the mccains or have we so quickly forgotten remember slick willie saying that obama should be getting him coffee and that this is the craziest thing he ever seen come on lastly with regards to obama in the harvard law review we know bush was student you can tell me the same about obama collegiate life personally these weren the biggest issues to me the association with tony rezko the whole chicago machine leaking an opponent divorce records and much more really showed me the true nature of the man	0

just wait he will turn as fast as revolving door and go back to his progressive stance if he loses or wins hell hath no fury like trumpetina scorned	0
don know how women find this guy attractive he is as ugly on the outside as he is in the inside hey know maybe trumpetina is going through man pause	0
amazing how you liberals preach tolerance and open mindedness then someone shakes up your little trumpetina snow globe and you fall to pieces man up and grow pair	0
the same zombies like you that are supporting trumpetina are the same zombies who voted for obama and here you are again side by side with the ows and rinos voting for the liberal progressive trump history repeats itself and you learned nothing from your mistake guess you are gluttons for more punishment	0
listen troll it is he who is stalking poor little meghan kelly the guy is uglier than sweaty pig in pig pen if trumpetina cant take the heat he can go back to his crib and suck on his binky	0
are you kidding this guy has the face of moldy ground beef and meghan has an obsession with him actually its the other way around hell hath no fury like trumpetina scorned by girl	0
yeah don have problem with the woman can you believe trumpetina is afraid of this little girl	0
exactly all these important issues need to be focused on and the only thing little trumpetina can focus on is meghan and calling people names hes about as useless as tits on boar	0
wah boohoo golly gee his holiness trumpetina needs to pull up his pampers and take it like man	0
and that is without exit-poll gate correlation of vote margin to electronic only voter deregistration missing registrations party flipping provisional ballot hell etc even being formally investigated in order to hopefully be falsified	0
nothing to do with voter deregistration that hit bernie and benefited clinton in the primary too	0
also there aren thousands of reports of deregistration there are verified records of people having been removed from the records and all of those have an explanation are some of those possibly erroneous undoubtedly but not nearly enough to conjure notions of suppression especially in an primary election where there is no actual motive for anyone to do that there are hundreds of people who claim they were not allowed to vote and most of those turn out to have never been registered as democrat	0
deregistration of democrats and delegates later on	0
there not really all that much in the way of attendant benefits you know what get out of my party membership the ability to vote in dem primaries something that many states don even explicitly tie to party membership and if wanted to incentivize deregistration switching over to an open primary would be pretty obvious first step outside of that the only people who really benefit from being member of party are the small minority who are heavily actively involved in politics	0
anecdotal evidence is only inherently invalid if it taken as an individual data point just like any single data point is invalid to draw conclusions from if anecdotal evidence is received in widespread numbers from unrelated sources and is consistent and verifiable then outright dismissal is just as silly as outright acceptance did couple minutes of independent research and found several published articles from bodies of journalism describing the large amount of people who had their polling place changed last minute and weren informed properly or randomly found themselves unregistered from voting as democrat the anecdotal evidence wasn something inherently invalid like facebook comments from individuals like any data set what matters is what you can interpret from it what do you think observational studies are other than collecting and analyzing large amounts of anecdotal evidence additionally the language used to confirm that vote-tallying machines in particular weren comprised along with the confirmation that access to voter registration information was compromised plus widespread reports of voter deregistration and polling place changes seem like enough to draw reasonable conclusion you think russia successfully hacked into voter registration lists and did nothing with it	0
how do you justify the information that came out from wikileaks and the confirmed reports of voter deregistration even though believe that you never experienced it in mass not suggesting legal action just confused by how people think the dnc wasnt clearly biased organization toward hillary clinton in the primaries	0
there are effective notification procedures in place should citizen lose voter registration in case the deregistration was in error	0
the evidence specifically of the voter deregistration and polling place changes within the private information that was compromised is most likely still classified within the intelligence community that being said did couple minutes of googling and found plenty of widespread anecdotal evidence	0
gt combined with an arguably large scale involvement in voter deregistration and only tampering russian ad buy could ve easily pushed trump over the line in some of the states he only won by pube hair	0
it majority of voters vs gop russia gerrymandering deregistration of minority poor voters active measures to discourage voting and insufficient polling places hours on election day in democratic areas in other words the usual fair elections	0
if on the off chance the american public perseveres through gerrymandering voter deregistration vote tampering and the most effective pervasive and utterly dominating propoganda machine the world has ever seen and manages to vote government into power able and willing to intervene into putin plan there will be terrifying reaction by our current government to prevent the loss of power because it can afford to lose	0
you should not have your voting rights taken away via deregistration because you did not vote in two consecutive elections	0
well yeah the blue wave will be hard slog it has to overcome the gop storm barriers of gerrymandering propoganda corruption and voter obstruction id deregistration defunding ballot locations	0
vote deregistration and voter suppression efforts reduce democratic output	0
deregistration people turned away because their registration was lost or removed	0
don intend to go full tinfoil and say that votes were changed though the mass voter deregistration in ny and the absurd requirement to switch party affiliation more than half year in advance are biiiiit fishy but the deck was stacked in her favor	0
and they ll do the same thing if they take the house and senate this year unlikely between voter suppression and deregistration campaigns plus misinformation plus hacking because they ll decide they rather run against weakened trump in than actually ever hold republican accountable for anything	0
you re spending too much time trying to sniff out conspiracy- never claimed hrc fixed the vote this is about the electoral process- should not have had to get court order to vote when was registered for months up until the week before the election even if it was clerical error which it may have been was never informed of my deregistration on top of that also witnessed at the boe someone who had an address change form filed on their behalf with forged signature	0
to your other point unfortunately there are indeed thousands of reports of deregistration they exist on facebook reddit twitter etc because that is the only forum for regular people you ll have an exact number once all of the affidavits are fully counted	0
the same micro targeting data would be useful for vote switching or voter deregistration in hacked election systems it achievable though challenging to model the amount of active vote count manipulation that would be detectable by us authorities which would be relatively large number given how poorly secured and auditable some state voter systems are then combine that with robust voter turnout model which tells you exactly how many votes in any given location need to be switched or eliminated to shift the electoral college to trump cross reference that list with systems you ve been able to penetrate apply your detection model to see if you can make sufficient changes without triggering audits and scrutiny and now you ve got recipe for stealing an election without anyone knowing it you could manipulate the vulnerable with propaganda and then if that not enough make up the difference with voter fraud	0
can we stop shitting on clinton for winning the popular vote when all is said and done with the investigation bet it will show she would have won the ec if not for voter deregistration and suspicious exit poll inconsistencies that people seem to have forgotten about	0
sanders is loosing because the dnc is cheating via mass deregistration and rigged voting machines	0
combine that with the rampant deregistration and there is an argument to made that he truly has the majority will of the people behind him even if he loses by few dozen delegates	0
so you re saying that only sanders voters are impacted by closed polling sites bad machines and deregistration despite clinton voters overwhelmingly coming from people who identify as strong democrats and minorities which would suffer from all three of those things more than white independents who are first time voters	0
voted every year since was eligible until when was dropped from the voter rolls goddamned times checked my registration in advance of the caucus because people were reporting issues in other states and was registered as republican registered as democrat the second year voted and hadn changed it since so fixed my registration got my card in the mail and went to the caucus with all the identification that was required was not on the voter rolls fortunately kansas has same day registration for primaries and caucuses so and about half of the other voters there some were new voters but heard similar stories of deregistration at an alarming rate registered again as democrat that day got my rd voter card in the mail about week later fast forward to couple week before the registration deadline for the general election and being paranoid because of the events described above checked my registration again and was no longer registered again so registered got my th card went to my polling site prepared with all of the evidence would need to fill out provisional ballot because fully expected to be dropped again was not however prepared for my precinct to be out of fucking provisional ballots because so many goddamned people had the same goddamned problem	0
democrats already get more votes than republicans no need to scrounge if not for gerrymandering automatic voter deregistration and the electoral college republicans would control branches of government	0
forcing deregistration of democratic voters on election day and targetting swing communities with political messaging is an act of war	0
it is quite believable that they used voter information from cambridge analytica and the state voter registration databases to perform targeted voter deregistration	0
then again it is also believable that the gop did that deregistration all on their own because names that sound like gonzolas aren their target demographic and more than likely will take vote away from the opposition	0
struggling to find the exact clip because all get are voice changer videos since she called that law firm actually didn know she did that until today will find it and send it to you that just one example though the wikileaks and the voter deregistration are probably the most egregious	0
gt active measures aktivnye meropriiatia against any opposition or would-be opposition are key part of the new governing formula over and above the use of black pr and kompromat see pages or the cruder types of administrative resource legal deregistration etc active measures proper involve the deployment of virtual objects or events created or staged by political technologists to weaken the oppostion this chapter defines the various types of project that have been developed in the former ussr and in the course of doing introduces the reader to some particularly strange local terminology	0
the deregistration that happened in few states were state matters and the bernie new registrations literally didn fully fill out their forms it takes good amount of mental gymnastics to blame hillary for your side not doing paperwork	0
argue that the deregistration of voters in an attempt to subvert the democratic process is pretty good indication that we re witnessing the end of democracy couple that with the religious fervor republicans have towards their party and you end up with block of citizens who believe the republicans can do know wrong and give them pass on suppressing votes so we win	0
jeb looked like he was little lost when marco came back at him yes but that not the first time jeb has looked lost br br just as in the third debate jeb had moments in the first two debates where he showed he was not up to the job he looked lame and forlorn as he was put in his place by other candidates he looked not like jeb but like an anemic jehb br br jehb still hasn come to terms with legacy which also includes the tea party freedom caucus crazies these radical right-wing republicans rose in anger not to failure to keep us safe or his warmongering which enraged the left but to his expanding medicare doubling the national debt and starting the wall street bailout br br the republican crazies are an angry crowd that suffered during the collapse of the economy they found was not real conservative and they were blind with anger furious with washington they ve directed their rage at president obama but it was presidency that brought them out of the woodwork br br so jehb has albatross around his neck and he hasn yet figured out what to do with it but even without legacy jehb has shown he clearly is not up to the job and like never was	0
interesting that george bush is coming out with memoir at this time memoir and claims that place the blame for his son treachery and incompetence upon the shoulders of his chosen court of neocons an attempt to absolve bush of responsibility for inflicting upon america its most damaging presidency an attempt to rewrite history just as jehb bush seeks the presidency br br george bush does not have clean hands his lies and subversion of the us constitution date back at least to his participation in the iran-contra treachery his invasion of iraq was for oil his attempt to place the blame for his son crimes against humanity on others is pathetic george bush should be prosecuted for his crimes he should serve life sentence for the murder of millions those killed during the invasion of iraq and those still dying today in the middle east turmoil that he created	0

jr hope your son is prescient calling it the trexit effect we might even call it the trumpit effect like the uk vote to leave the eu brexit the people polled either wouldn answer for various reasons or didn tell them the truth as such the leftists were completely taken by surprise good dose of leftist voter apathy was involved as well mostly the youth vote was absent hopefully the young berned ones vote for the un-elec tables or just stay home few will vote for trump the msm and the establishment are seeing the trend in europe and as such just blatantly lie and deceive the american public hoping to discourage the same effect from taking hold in the us they are very afraid of this if trump wins the american version trexit or trumpit if you prefer will be the msm and the pollsters worst nightmare an electorate that refuses to be controlled if stronger than expected youth vote is shown to have gone this way it will bode well for their generation and america as nation and sure you are hoping that this comes true	1

in healthy democracy parties compete when competing is the right thing to do they cooperate when cooperating is the right thing to do republicans and democrats used to cooperate all the time on issues that were important to their country and issues that they could agree on now republicans automatically oppose whatever helps the democrats that not healthy democracy jill stein helping trump get elected helps install putinocracy it throws all her green voters under the bus in the process responsible green candidate would have aligned with democrats once it was clear stein wasn going to be elected	1
sounds like putinocracy	1
worry more about what person with so much love for rival nuclear power and authoritarian rule could do with the office of president all this talk about election fairness won mean much in putinocracy	1

lemmie guess from now on they will only poll for responses at negro churches and solid blue congressional districts	0
proof again that it does no good to try to reason or compromise with leftist liberals like suckerborg they will always insist that their agenda is much more important than your right to free speech or the right to speak on behalf of the political candidate of your choice lemmie guess glenn beck told facebook it was ok to censor trump supporters just back off of the religious right	0

mr cohn does an admirable job of posing the numbers and peering at the percentages only to stumble at the finish line br br democrats are basically satisfied with clinton br br what millions of average americans are pumping small donations to the only candidate not taking legalized bribes from corporate and billionaire donors it interesting that connecticut harbors the purdue pharmaceutical group stalwart democratic donors of the sackler family br br mrs clinton cries for the victims of prescription drug overdoses but high production levels have made the sackler family billionaires enabled by the fda to become rivals of the medell cartel but without the fuss of dea scrutiny br br bernie sanders has hold on the new fda director nominee before the senate our donations help stop the drug dealing while hillary takes the money and looks the other way br br sanders is practical centrist his policies come from asking what best for all americans the affluent liberal is only happy with hillary because she taken their money and promised smooth ride on the gravy train numbers are great but they don express which way the wind is blowing	0
you seem to be unaware that the landmarked mckim meade white brooklyn museum no longer fits your description and that the emphasis is on the feminist wing of elizabeth sackler yes the sports photo exhibit was excellent perhaps it not important to want to go to museum to be moved by the paintings by the way they restructured the american wing	0
the media ignores another sanders victory hillary internal polling told her she was going to lose indiana four days ago and her aides had her scamper to appalachia before any of it landed on her pantsuit br br yesterday she had her hat handed to her by common coal miner and then went into soliloquy about opiods having taken the lives of friends children she wrung her hands and almost blurted out can feel your pain br br meanwhile sanders has hold on obama big pharma insider pick to run the fda br br but the sackler family are double-uppers to the democratic establishment poor hillary hands are tied by million in traceable cash from big pharma and the oxycontin epidemic is just going to have to keep simmering the fda chief could force production cuts tomorrow but drug dealers contributions come first br br hillary yammered on about big jobs program for coal miners but forgot the details of how it could be funded to save their jobs meanwhile in search of her own job she lot better prepared to see that effort funded in ways beyond our sense of propriety br br and you wonder why we will not abandon bernie sanders it called character	0

please do and encourage the rest of the douchery to follow your example	1
the cause of categorical douchery is not the cause of free speech other than incidentally the longest standing axiom of free speech the notable quotable that easiest to use to articulate its value to free society is the old disagree with what you say but will defend to the death your right to say it what could one do to make that harder premise for someone to agree with than being rude vicious little bastard solely for the satisfaction of it and not for the advancement of inimical cause or truth spoken to power so trolling his art form may be an expression of free speech but it about the least useful in history if the point is to make people appreciate and value the concept of free speech all trolls do is make people associate free speech with being dbag	1
well like said im more of fiorina fan but im sure you will have something douchery to say about that as well	1
what this boils down to is this--a band never heard of has banned me from concert would never attend because of excessive douchery	1
bunch of hollywood a-holes with high priced gun-toting bodyguards want to tell me how allowed to protect my family you all in strange sort of way all the tv and movies that now boycotting because of all these clowns has freed up lot of my time to pursue more constructive activities so in sense want to thank you hollywood for being the supreme force of douchery that you are	1
so sorry you re inflamed ignorance you must have touched an infected toilet seat after stupid person used it they say homophobics re really closet gays that just haven come out both of these statements are examples of mental douchery	1
apparently you haven been listening to cruz and beck the last several days and what they have been saying about trump douchery is two way street and trump will fire back can respect that	1
felt the same way then imagined her with anthony weiner it not so much the physical but the one-world-government rabble-hating liberal douchery that kills it	1
you credited yourself for converting them pure un-adulterated admission of douchery	1
haven looked at them the same since believe it was the campaign when an artists for obama video was released and kiedis pledged to be of service to barack obama while kissing his bicep if they weren known to be hard core socal progs id have thought it was bit of sarcasm it was just douchery plain and simple	1
personally think the gop has ruined public opinion of conservatives with their obstructionism and general douchery	1
always fun to read the last few posts on day old pailin story swear you can see the spiddle marks from all the frothing trolls that have spent all day here	0
sarah palin only wishes someone once in her sad life would ever consder her smart she the perfect trump spokesman this dummy tosses out words like dc elites insider and smart set to position anyone that against trump as part of the elite class well sarah when you re done being paid spokes-hole for trump ypu may want to realize that so many people hate trump not because their elitists but because he and you are stupid people what pailin also fails to mention in twist of predictable idiotic irony on her part is that andrew brietbart hated donald trump and saw him as complete phony	0
waiting for pailin to start	0
truth hurts don it the only thing sarah nut job pailin ever said that made sense was you can put lipstick on pig but it still pig any fool with one eye and half brain knows that the conservative movement in the us is full of racists bigots and people too stupid to engage in conversation without name calling alas this is the what the breitbart attracts see if you can come back without name calling bet you can	0
at least pailin will call like she see it	0
trump pailin	0
even that smarter than pailin	0
pailin flatters herself the lint in my sock drawer is smarter than her	0
some of these comments here are disappointing and some are sickening is anyone still willing to support the country and fight obi the libs and the rinos or are you content to fight girl and whine about trump cruz pailin and probably walker we work together or we are done	0
respect mccain for his military service but that about it what trump said is true mccain was terrible choice for candidate in and would not have received many votes had it not been for his running mate gov pailin her association with mccain likely derailed her political career the only more awful choice we could have made for president in was the current disaster in the white house	0
genitalia have nothing to do with it yes pailin stepping back further thatcher remains one of liberty greatest leaders now having significant private industry resume is lot stronger than the snipey tag that she got fired am not in her camp at this point but want to hear lot more about her real positions and principles this outing did not do her much good for me in the meantime	0
pailin apears on stage cue the hyped anime music one puuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuunch boom it over libs	0
finished watching the rally in tulsa ok sarah palin was on point tonight and she sounded much better more poised and less screeching her part was short and hit all the points that make trumps campaign more than just electing conservative great start for pailin role in stumping for the donald	0
john mccain az has staffer doing his dirty work sticking knife in sarah pailin back because she tired of people with no spines allowing our country to be misguided if the ship captain is supposed to go to the bahamas and suddenly the passengers discover he is out of control and heading to the the freezing waters of the antarctic then you need someone with cajones to stop him john mccain has proven time and time again that he is gelding	0
picking an unknown as vp candidate is fraught with danger mccain lost because he picked moron palin george hw bush won despite picking another moron quayle imo trump needs to pick someone who offsets trump own bombastic approach and represents the voice of reason on the ticket and trump needs to pick someone who is an expert on foreign policy and will be able to survive media scrutiny remember pailin can see russia from my backyard	0
pailin has masterfully worked behind the scenes to build revolutionary real conservative base believe her running for office days have long passed pailin is far more valuable to the movement right where she is	0
amen also mr trump senator cruz gov pailin mark levin glen beck and everyone else all gave great speeches at the dc rally today	0
wow was never one to agree with pailin before but agree with much of what she is saying now	0
thank you sarah pailin hope she can convince trump that the smart choice is non-establishment or outsider	0
guess you didn get out very much back in the sarah palin era someone should defecate in sarah pailin mouth that the gist of this guy idiotic blather	0
he been shown to be liar today anyway as outlined via close friend of sarah pailin that what he needs to address because it is key regarding his credibility this response could well be an attempt to distract from what appears to be very open and shut case he trying to go after breitbart to distract from sarah palin justifiable problem with his behaviour anyway even this case is watertight he cannot dispute what he said on record	0
also she turning trump face comment from carly issue to women issue what phony plus if she really supports netanyahu and israel where was she last week when trump cruz mark levin sarah pailin michelle bachman and others were at pennsylvania avenue to protest the iran deal donald trump and	0
anyone else gonna fire up nailin pailin this evening she truly is great american	0
endorse trump pailin you know every other republican candidate is in the pockets of wall street and the coc and couldn give damn about average hard working americans	0
not pailin it would hurt the trump train	0
pailin wasn defended by her own side look at those crooked inside mccain operators nicole wallace and that guy who wrote book the campaign managers who were throwing her under the bus to excuse their ineptitude go back and look at palin speech from the rnc in it was masterful first time in front of so large crowd live to millions and she owned that stage btw that was also the problem she was more compelling than the mcshame so they fed her to the wolves aka couric without properly prepping her go back and watch her debate with biden then watch biden vs ryan biden didn own palin at all but he stomped ryan who let remember has failed up	0
this video is funny and do love sarah pailin and her family hilarious george carlin guys named todd	0
you did when pailin backed trump	0
is john mccain losing it has he been around too long admire him in some ways but have seen him as seriously flawed since he had the unpatriotic gall to inflict upon this country--one heartbeat from the presidency--the supremely unqualified sara pailin as the nation first trailer-trash candidate for vice president that when cast the first vote of my long life for the democratic candidates for president vice president hope that at least after his primary election is over he will finally show profile in courage this year by denouncing donald trump	0
obama quotes jefferson the mohammedan should have his faith protected in the united states obama casually forgets to mention that jefferson also formed the marines to combat the barbary pirates who were ta da muslims that where the marine term leathernecks came from leather to protect them in battle from the swords of the mohammedan also want to know which aid found that quote because blobama never reads the documents of the white slave masters	1

moderate libertarian voting for johnson so your attempt at disparagement falls very flat with me give you for effort at least you tried to act hard guess lol of course black people aren anymore advanced than anyone never said they were trump stated in an interview that they had advantages that white men of equal qualifications didn have various published studies prove that wrong if you take issue with the statement it not me you should be taking issue with over it if you don understand the racist implications of it then can help you there yay for the guy who was excited to be called trumps african american guess and winning over minorities lololol ok yes one employee recanted and he was probably paid off or threatened since that same employee claimed he didn want to be identified in the case because he was afraid that the trumps would have him knocked off or words to that effect because he told me about their allegedly discriminatory practices according to the affidavit you re also leaving out the various testers they had going around and reporting on the actual discrimination practices of the trumps yes there were buildings that had blacks and hispanics those are the buildings that employees would direct them to when they would falsely claim no openings in all or nearly all white buildings as to me needing more info think you might want to look more closely at the case yourself case you obviously didn know anything about since you initially claimed that donald repaired the issue when he took over management lol according to trump the deals and the downfall donald deposition in the case in march of caught the essence of his social conscience he didn know what the fair housing act of was and freely admitted that the company had done nothing to implement it trump the deals and the downfall other rental agents employed by the trumps told the fbi that only percent of tenants at the trump-run ocean terrace apartments were black and that there were no black tenants at lincoln shore apartments both were on ocean parkway in brooklyn however minorities were steered to different complex on flatbush avenue in brooklyn patio gardens which was percent black the government said one black woman for example was turned away at heavily white complex but told that she should try to obtain an apartment at patio gardens where black judge had recently become tenant according to government filings two former trump employees husband and wife who rented properties were quoted in court documents as saying they were told that the company wanted to rent only to jews and executives and discouraged rental to blacks the couple told the government lawyers that they were advised that racial code was in effect blacks being referred to as no trump did what he always does when called out on something double down on it ve followed him for decades now and this is his pattern he lost even though he ll never admit it because he got no money on his counter suit wasted money on very expensive lawyer and had to comply with government regulations he did it again in when he was found in contempt of the decree if reality show donald is the first you re paying attention to this guy then very sorry that you got sucked into his con job he not going to make anything better for you donald only makes things better for donald always has always will	0

first regards and thank you for agreeing with the sentiment but respectfully beg to differ with your assertion that tens of millions of caribbeans here in the potentially beneficiaries of reparations is that much over-stated as is always the case with immigration numbers the numbers are always under-reported and minimized for reasons which are obvious to almost all of us from migrationpolicy org in the united states was home to million immigrants from the caribbean who accounted for percent of the total foreign-born population more than percent of these immigrants came from cuba the dominican republic jamaica haiti and trinidad and tobago and cuban immigrants in particular have been among the top ten foreign-born groups in the united states each decade since so if we take into account the underreporting which is common with immigration statistics which tend to understate the actual number of immigrants we can safely say there are roughly million caribbean immigrants and keep in mind middle-class cubans who fled fidel in the late early think marco rubio parents considered themselves white but many if not most revolutionary cubans who stayed on the island of cuba to help out with the revolution but then came to the during the late- marielito boat-lift era and later the marielitos prostitutes of both genders low-level street drug pushers other assorted criminals consider themselves proudly black hispanic yes but black too they ll be asking for money those who are here in the if reparations ever become concrete see also blatinos and don forget the puerto ricans they ll be emphasizing the african part of their tres raices formula and fountain near by la princesa all for that free too anyway assuming million of the above-listed roughly million caribbeans yes including cubans are women and assuming each caribbean woman bore only only one child here in the that is million million kids million caribbeans my guess is the live birthrate for each caribbean woman who immigrated into the here is uhhhh more than just child have you even been to the haitian projects in montreal liberty city in miami flatbush bushwick ve been to the montreal projects and of course brooklyn and haitian families do not limit themselves to uhhhh just child as for nyc it alone has roughly half-a-million caribbean immigrants not counting their children who are all culturally caribbean west indian and who still speak patois under-reporting of the true numbers of west indians whether in nyc or wherever in the is rampant just as is under-reporting of mexican illegals everyone especially those who live in nyc knows this source url url made visible remove spaces of course http www nyc gov html dcp pdf census nny nny_ pdf the newest new yorkers edition many statistics from earlier years etc total nyc native-born recall you can be native-born to illegals no problem you re automatically citizen thanks to jus soli foreign-born jamaica guyana guyana was british at one time british guiana until haiti trinidad tobago no break-down listings for the minor islands of the caribbean you can bet they re all here in nyc too so that foreign-born caribbean-born officially add in illegals under-counted issues then add in children who are culturally caribbean and quite black and who speak patois better than standard american english and you ve got easily caribbeans right in nyc alone and we re not even talking miami the home of trayvonn friend rachel genteal which is filled with haitians see liberty city riots so we re already into the millions of caribbeans considering the larger cities of the east coast boston all the way down to miami with baltimore and in-between not to mention the sprinklings of caribbeans in virginia and north carolina and not to mention the minor islands input via immigration and first-generation patois-speaking children so don think tens of millions nation-wide is much of an over-statement wikipedia caribbean immigration to new york city new york city has significant populations of jamaicans haitians trinidadians guyanese bajans belizeans grenadians saint lucians and bahamians jamaicans-- jamaicans are the largest group of american immigrants from the english-speaking caribbean however it is difficult to verify the exact number of jamaican americans in this country the census placed the total number of documented jamaican americans at but the high jamaican illegal alien phenomenon and the jamaican attitude toward census response may increase that number to to jamaicans living in the united states government statistics report that jamaicans live in new york but the number is closer to large numbers of jamaicans are present in brooklyn the bronx and queens haitians-- new york city has the largest concentration of haitians in the united states as well as the oldest established haitian communities of the country the conservative estimate of the legal haitian population in the new york city metropolitan area as recorded by ins is approximately however community leaders and directors of community centers who come in constant contact with the illegal population strongly believe that the actual number is closer to this number includes the non-immigrant temporary visitors students temporary workers and trainees and undocumented entrants as well as the legal population who does not bother to fill out the census forms for variety of reasons moreover the new york city haitian population represents very heterogeneous group reflecting the various strata of haitian society members of the middle class started migrating during the occupation in the and at the time they established their enclaves in harlem where they mingled with african americans and other caribbean immigrants who were contributing to the harlem renaissance significant waves followed exponentially during the duvalier era that started in and ended in with the ousting of baby doc these waves were more heterogeneous than previous ones as no single class of haitians was immune from the duvaliers dictatorship to date cohorts of haitians continue to come to new york many being sent for by relatives already established in the city haitians reside in all the boroughs flatbush brooklyn has the highest concentration of haitians in the city every nyc er knows the west indian day parade in brooklyn is notorious it was written up in the news wires for the drive-by shoot-in-the-head murder of one of governor cuomo bureacratic flunkeys who went back home to celebrate the day it notorious partly for the large numbers of people who attend and trust me non-caribbeans especially whites who might still live down there in park slope prospect park brooklyn library main branch brooklyn museum area do not rush to attend and so the major attendance of this large notorious parade is west indian west indian derived see kids popped out by naturalized caribbean parents all one has to do is google the phrase caribbean black population nyc you will note the contribution of the hart-cellar-ted kennedy immigration reform act mentioned in one article queens the african american migration to queens began about the time of the first world fair and the completion of the triborough bridge in the initial migration came from harlem leading to parts of northern queens such as east elmhurst and corona housing prices began to fall in the at the same time as numbers of immigrants from the caribbean began to move in west indians those mostly from jamaica trinidad barbados grenada and other caribbean island-nations were able to move to the us because of the hart-cellar immigration act from and until about the number of west indians or caribbeans migrating to america skyrocketed if reparations ever does start to become more concrete and it will under any democrat president going forward the issue will still be bubbling even after terms of trump presidency just waiting to be paid off by the democrat president who wins in you can bet millions and millions of black caribbeans will magically appear from out of the shadows just like mexican illegals when there is free involved you will then see quite literally tens of millions of black caribbeans demanding their share of the money pot you can bet on it	0

if this is indeed true the leave camp are going to make sure this is all over the news for the next months this is ammunition sent by god and if the eu and the remain camp deny its existence then it going to be very difficult for them to pursue this we all know camoron and co lie through their stinking teeth every single day of their lives so let see then exposed for what they are this is very toxic issue and could pull million over from remain to leave btw germany said they need million more people to shore up their economy and so they opened up the floodgates not realising the type of people they were letting in who are pretty much less then useless they refuse to learn german they refuse to accept western culture most can even read or write in their own language let alone in german they want to gang western women they walk into shops with no money and fill their arms with goods they refuse to pay for anything in the inferior west they think our children are toys for their enjoyment they certainly are not going to be boost for the german economy having realised their folly they want to push the problem onto everyone else and to add insult to injury they want to make sure everyone else pays no way not in million years and can not see any country volunteering in hurry to put their hand in their tax payer pockets because of german greed and arrogance	1
they should be obliged to take certain number in proportion to the average number of gimmegrants in state schools mean if diversity is so good for us then it must also be good for upper middle class tw ts like camoron and his family too	1

and now camoron will apparently allow three thousand children here children means year old just like the one that stabbed this young woman how stupid is our government there are very few young children without parents	1
merkel camoron hollande obama all marxist filth but who what pulls their strings jews arabs banksters big business lobbies bilderberg masonics nwo some secret communist organisation they re not planning it all themselves they re too stupid	1

the great unwashed out on parade again how many from camoron uaf wonder	1
agree miliband is twice the man camoron is that not saying much but whilst disliking miliband despise camoron and everything he stands for he also sly as box of monkeys and coward	1
it was not me but have posted few times in the past about my view that there will be house to house massacres and beheadings by muslims even then the left will not be able to change their position they would try and save face are you talking about the uk government if so bet that was met with resistance by camoron	1
we need mechanism where we can prosecute politicians for lies nothing would please me more than to see mandlebum clagg camoron and all the others who lied in the dock	1

bliar took the nation to war all based on lies bliar opened the gates to the hell of mass immigration bliar made political correctness the law of the land hra bliar turned the administration into mush of neither civil nor servile equality quotas bliar promised to go for bust go that extra mile for green targets co emissions limitations and conspired with the eu politburo to stuff britain up the rear end industrial suicide via the green agenda camoron arrived and changed nothing in fact under dave most economic indicators not least the national debt went south and some of us realized that call me dave was is more of an extreme left wing dingbat than is ah la toenee curse the tories as do the nu lavs and back to ted the traitor and that slug harold wilson and with his cultural marxist slime balls crosland jenkins et al ll only say one thing for osborne at least he stayed on to steady the ship whereas dave great patriot that he tells us he is did capn costa concordia aye but the trouble is dave you misread the political and economic situation wot again you could have stayed on been good lad and guided steered britain to freedom man could but oh no like sulky child did she tell you to you jumped ship and now in honouring that aforementioned bunch of w-anchors what total shi head you proved yourself to be mr camoron and incidentally on here most of us were not in the least bit surprised so get thee gone charlatan childish to er and ponce dave	1
probably camoron	1
msm extensive ignorance dissimulation to engage large-scale civil disturbances mass invasions financial chicanery and in the last resort war foreign or domestic even the wimplike camoron recent phrase about ex-britain being racist is sufficient indication of the likelihood--i mean the historically demonstrated likelihood that elites will gladly destroy their own people new yorkers have intimate knowledge of such machinations indeed it has happened before	1
slightly off topic but hope still pertinent with all this buggering around with the leadership election of the tories and no sign whatsoever of article being invoked where does the speaker stand in all of this can he take over and run the country with camoron mucking about with his resignation can the speaker invoke article on our behalf under the premise that government and the will of the people must carry on or would the speaker have to have an audience with the queen first as far as am aware we have never been in this position before so the answers to the above are not obvious or so it seems to me if you are more informed than please reply	1
honestly can see camoron being in charge for very long whether boris would be any better who knows no one could be much worse but think boris is now fighting for his political future and he is going to try hard to appeal to tory faithful	1
don you mean camoron	1
true yet what deceitful self serving shower the conservative are under the conniving duplicitous liar camoron time to sack the lot and start again coup is overdue	1
comment noted it should also be noted that camoron refuses to debate with farage that something to think about vis corbyn too	1
think that the british electorate particularly those who scrawl an by any scum party candidate name have laboured if you ll excuse the pun laboured under delusion that somehow and by some astounding leap of faith that the uk scum party would are representatives of the working class the uk labour party are no cuddly rose tinted version of warm hearted philanthropic group and given to doing good works and supporting the british working man what we see now those running this septic political class the champagne socialists and north london wankerati the frankfurt school devotees are ruthless and extreme left wing marxists who don give flying about you the electorate or indeed anyone in britain the british branch of critical theorists their only goal is power and perpetuating that hegemony it is hard not to notice it how much favour and nepotism is the rage in north london circles and who all send their sons and daughters to private ie fee paying education pious to tee arrogant hypocrisy beyond compare for god sakes these public sector aristocracy those socialist scum are running the political sphere the media indeed the country cultural marxism has won that claque of or so of grauniadistas are telling us all what to do and how to say it political correctness in their view it ok to hate jews and to praise and prostrate yourself at the feet of izlam it all about votes it says all you need to know about corbyn pro eu shill who says he will not share platform with certain remainian tory bigshots mentioning no names dave true enough myself would have problem with standing on stage with camoron but am not politician and yet have my own mind whereas corbyn has no excuse he has shared platform with variety of loons delusional nutters killes the ira and various deviants from the creed of death not stand together with dave what excuse can corbyn proffer the uk labour party have opened the covers and invited in the wolves to sleep with us all the labour party daily court and protect their allies and friends in the new community the labour party has always hated britons and britain the creed of cultural marxism all its efforts are to effect division hate separateness and conquer as the labour party hyenas tear themselves itself asunder and not before time it must be said we witness new alignment in british politics my great fear is the swp and the creed of death will reform under one banner black flag finally if ever there was an argument for reunification of the british electorate working class middle class sensible class white van man class and all naturally ardent patriots nationalists and small ip would should be the answer	1
remember that cuunt camoron stating hope to see muzslime as pm one day during its notorious see too many white faces speech	1

another staggering decision by the grand mufti camoron and situation normal in yorkshire	1
no chance they re just doing camoron spouting load of bullsh to keep the natives happy	1
cameron has never had any respect for the tory grassroots so why they seem perplexed by this is rather surprising camoron is robot who does what he is told by the global elite who will then be rewarded when he leaves politics tony blair is good example the biggest risk of the eu referendum is voter fraud	1
there about as much chance of camoron campaigning to leave as there ever was of meaningful renegotiation anyone that voted conservative should be ashamed of themselves	1
that would look good on camoron tomb stone	1
so superior to all these eu lovers what shame camoron will not debate with nigel love to see that fool brought down to earth	1
think camoron will always be remembered as cameron the liar master of the turn spouter of bullsh and unable to tell truth from fiction the only good thing he did was to hold the referendum had he had the guts to campaign to leave the eu he would have been hailed as hero not derided as political pigmy	1
we saw it coming we voted brexit now we have another unelected by the people globalist camoron in dress she promises we will brexit but is deeply untrustworthy woman who considers sharia law would be good in our country we shall see if we get brexit the real deal and not some reworked eu deal in the weeks to come do not feel very hopeful	1

disgraceful the leave stand was no more obstructing the highway than the remain stand breitbart should also contact camoron corbyn with copy of the video and ask them for statement on this harassment none will be forthcoming but their silence will speak volumes this is classic old-school local bigwigs who consider that they decide and everyone else must obey that sort of behaviour fell by the political wayside long ago there is no reason to allow valley of political dinosaurs to reappear in south wales or anywhere else	1

am afraid that both christianity and islam have invested such different personalities into the divine that it is self-evident that all three so-called abrahamic faiths are worshiping quite different deity both christianity and islam are predicated on supercessionism replacement theology of judaism and christianity certainly has such systematically warped view of judaism that do not think it ever had true concept of the old testament g-d at all as for the church of england whatever it was supposed to be historically the large numbers of clergy having left it over women ordination has rendered it nothing more than another vehicle for gender politics and liberalism with hard core of born again biblical evangelical literalists who do not in fact subscribe to anglican doctrine at all and are interlopers who have no business in it don see that changing in the near future as wrote to someone else recently it is useful to look at those societies which have recently adopted christianity africa china and korea and see the one underlying common element as societies trying to establish the rule of law and civil government which is the one task at which christianity eventually succeeded in the wake of the collapse of rome in europe it seems that christianity main corpus of doctrine encompassing both catholic and protestant theology does not lend itself to an advanced educated society and unless and until it reforms itself into more systematically plausible faith which may be on the cards its future in the west will be one of minority faith this leaves the threat of even greater literalism and fundamentalism in islam am afraid that the spiritual future of the west does not bode well	0
sure you think that catholics don understand either nor do liberal christians so basically there probably about couple dozen people who apparently according to you are capable of understanding this bible supposedly dictated by your perfect god lol the fact that you fail to see the contradiction in that alone is just hilarious science is self-correcting and will change as needed when new evidence arises as it has many times in the past for example the caloric theory of heat models of the atom and newton laws of motion requiring general relativity to apply to fast speeds your book on the other hand is the opposite it is an unchanging snapshot of human mythology from years ago that requires literalists to jump through mental hula hoops of pseudoscience to make the evidence fit the presupposed conclusion that it is correct not hostile at all to scripture think it contains insight into human psychology some history some mythology some beauty and some good lessons attributing it to perfect god though and claiming it as literal objective truth is logically indefensible	0
people are such literalists with absolutely no imagination or ability to understand anything outside the box trump knows how to negotiate he ll say to the palestinians gee you got really nice chunk of land there in gaza and the west bank would be shame to see it taken away from youze guys if you don stop trying to kill israelis you want to keep it right you gettin my drift	0
they indeed had to have divided loyalties but the founders were far from today biblical literalists they did not approach scripture as literal and perfect divine blueprint on which the state should be modeled rather looking at their correspondence you find the bible used for philosophical inspiration to support principles when they harmonized with scripture to add spice to their speeches and thoughts you do not see madison saying that the us should have divinely appointed judge because god says so in scripture nor do you see adams arguing the principle of free speech should be limited because god does not support blasphemy you don see them advocating the revelation of the holy spirit through prophecy to determine leadership as scripture recommends the founders don use revelations and biblical prophecy to determine their foreign policy you don see them applying the laws and regulations of the bible as absolute commands from god that what biblical literalists do rejecting all other forms of law and knowledge as manmade and inferior to god vision the framers were not modern evangelical christians there are about as many references in their works to ancient pagan intellectuals like cicero and plato as there are to scripture yet you wouldn argue that they believed in paganism or cicero because they use him for philosophical inspiration the problem with biblical literalists and evangelicals is their firm conviction in the absolute authority and literal truth of all scripture as well as the absolute guidance of god and the holy spirit without any tempering authority as the founders had that zeal and earnestness of literal belief is what makes modern day evangelicals somewhat more disturbing than the faith of the founders	0
duh man you literalists	0
speaking of lies and indoctrination not many people know the actual story of the scopes monkey trials which was actually put-on tourist sensation meant to draw tourists to dayton tennessee the whole thing was planned in advance most atheists prefer the propaganda version of that story told in the movie inherit the wind the problem with your attack against biblical literalists is that it has little to do with what we were talking about since they are not traditional version of christianity they are not the future of christianity and they are not even majority of christianity myself find the topic of evolution to be overrated have very little interest in it because to me it is as interesting as some other scientific topics like the cure for some kind of cancer only dogs get and really for most of us the only sane approach toward the topic of evolution is benign neglect and it is mostly those who care about the topic out of ideological zealotry hash it out as if it was the most interesting topic in the world to me accept the best science on the matter is the best science on the matter until it is replaced by better science on the matter and christianity other than the bible literalists you mentioned doesn have dog in that fight as said it is not topic am well versed on and suspect am right to not pay it too much mind given that years from now the science we know about it right now will be as out of date and as big joke as the science of years ago is now now science that can serve me in some material way that am interested in as all sane thinking people should be imo but as to the difference between god and the gods you listed that is something am interested in talking about no other religion has recorded such interaction with god over such long period of time as the interaction the hebrews and later the christians had through the bible quantity and quality of divine revelation the number of miracles recorded by christians since the bible has been extensive and is the basis for much of the conversions to christianity for example mary appearing on mexican tilma converted millions of aztecs and the image itself is very interesting given that her eyes show the reflections of the people seeing the vision no other god has inspired as much charity and good works for the poor and suffering these gods and religions you speak of inspired the rd world the st world with all our advances and ordered liberty rose up in what was called christendom the quality of life of those who practice christianity tends to be better than the other religions you mentioned	0
list of sun gods thunder and lightning gods and moon lunar gods that don believe in and neither do you the problem is you can provide any difference between these and thousands of others and your god think lot of really smart people can be taught an obvious lie if they are indoctrinated early in life like sunday school and hitler youth religious fundamentalists and biblical literalists present any number of arguments that attempt to disprove evolution those with sympathetic ear often fail to critically examine these creationist claims leading to an ill-informed public and perhaps more troubling ill-advised public policy every single argument deployed by creationists in their attacks on evolution is founded on fundamental scientific religious and historical falsehoods all of them among their most popular claims is that evolution is religion that there are no transitional species that there are no beneficial mutations and that supposedly sacred scripture is the infallible word of god yet as the evidence and data plainly show each of these claims is demonstrably and unequivocally false there is simply no truth to creationism whatsoever and the entire enterprise rests on foundation of falsehoods	0
some people are literalists they need that sarcasm tag	0
the book says these people deserve death just as isis does you could interpret that as license to kill glad you and other christians don but the book says what it says as is the case with isis you can accuse them of being literalists and being murderers but you cannot accuse them of heresy because they are doing what the book tells them to do soldiers taking virgins as booty of war no sex involved think you need to get your god-glasses checked	0
you are taking your coexist bumper sticker way too seriously we are at war with islam but so far the only ones who know this are the muslims there was period of ijtihad in the th centuries so-called period of open inquiry in which various schools of thought vied for supremacy within islam the mutua zillis the ones who wanted to take mohammed depraved teachings metaphorically and allegorically started out on top got too arrogant and bloodthirsty with their ideological opponents the ashari the muts were all decapitated in the blowback from the angry literalists the asharias open inquiry ended case settled off with the heads of infidels and apostates for the next years conflating christianity and islam in terms of who can generate the most depraved acts of religious persecution can at first sound productive in establishing moral equivalence between the two problem is those who burn tyndale at the stake for his crime violated jesus teachings and betrayed the whole of the new testament spirit those who kill salman rushdi in the name of mohammed honor mo continuous stream of koranic incitements to brutality in the spreading of islam the books of each religion shall judge the violent within each the bible opposes and condemns those who persecute in christ name the koran praises them and promises those who kill for allah perpetual virgins for their victims pains the bottom line islam is in the overreach stage of its life cycle the west can even speak the name of its oppressor and looks like it going down in helpless pathetic submission that because it is some islamic group will thinking they re at history finish line perpetrate some monstrously egregious act of mass terrorism and that country leader will drop nuke or two on mecca trump versed in counter punching netanyahu deploying the samson option at some point of israeli national distress absent mecca islam cannot ecclesiastically theologically or emotionally function imagine if some archaeologist found the authentic tomb of christ and his body was still in there instant suicidal despair same thing with nuked mecca allah is instantly akbar-less and an akbar-less allah is no allah at all no holy shrine to visit or pray to or gain forgiveness for sins in it all over baby	0
callawyn disagree with your first statement indeed christians accept the whole bible old and new testaments as the inspired word of god jews accept the old testament as the inspired word of god too yet they do not really believe in practice or apply it uniformly just because someone claims their scripture is the word of god does not mean they practice it or believe in it piously and devoutly think you take an awfully simplistic view of complex religion islam has vast multitude of beliefs there are thousands of variations ranging from extreme orthodoxy to heterodox to superficial just as in all religions case in point in turkey most would claim to be muslim and if asked would probably say that they believe the quran is the inspired word of god but that doesn prevent people from everywhere consuming alcohol ignoring ramadan not praying uniformly when required ve seen it myself so one cannot use scripture and someone professed belief in it to conjecture about their actual beliefs or practice your second statement is also problematic indeed muslims may admire the hadiths yet there are groups that reject all of them too quranists but there are multiple conflicting collections of hadiths and they have varying degrees of trust and respect among different groups not to mention vast and conflicting interpretive tradition as well because islam is congregational there is actually no islamic authority with any universal weight or respect they may have respect in one group and be meaningless to another group each muslim congregation is independent and can choose to regard or disregard any authority in the islamic world so no one actually speaks for the religion as whole or guides or controls how congregations and individuals observe and believe in islam there no way to establish on meeting an individual muslim what their beliefs are you have to actually trace out which large group they belong to what teachings their mosque subscribes to their national heritage look at their practices maybe then you might be able to categorize their beliefs in this large and complex religion but each person and congregation will vary from another most muslims are probably not educated enough in their religion to even describe all the elements of their belief just as few christians are theologians and few jews are talmudic scholars so few muslims are that invested in religious study what referred to in my comment about the reformation was the notion that belief can be decided by hierarchical system with recognized leadership that can decide on matters of doctrine and then impose them on laypeople conceptually this is what responsible not technological changes that concept is what made the christian reformation possible as well as the christian idea of orthodoxy and heterodoxy that hierarchy can determine correct and incorrect beliefs universally for group lutherans used this as did catholics in the muslim world without hierarchy or belief that authority figures can universally determine belief there is no way to use religious council say to alter the religion as well because islam lacks conception that there is an authority that judges the only one right way to practice the religion because of its congregationalism there no authority figure like the pope to oppose and no way to set up an alternate authority figure like the calvinist presbytery any mosque could choose to regard or disregard any authority proposing or opposing reformation so it more complex issue judaism actually operates similarly to this authority-less system so am familiar with it though where we differ is that jews don actually care about belief at all or variances in belief because they have no belief in discoverable objective truth will agree that these militant groups are indeed very traditionalist embodiment of literal interpretation of islamic scriptures but literalists in all religions are terrifying and never completely dominant group christian literalists the dominionists want to overturn the constitution and establish an american theocracy based on scripture that actually what literal reading of the bible would produce the reformation anabaptists that took over muenster were also scary biblical literalists most muslims are far from literalists and indeed literalist groups confronted in time by the fact that their own literalism condemns most of their members tend to fall apart under the weight of their own dogmas isis is indeed manifestation of literalist readings but when you discuss history think you are somewhat mistaken indeed in an earlier post pointed out that for all of the quran violent verses the great muslims empires the umayyads the ottomans muslim spain the mughals the safavids did terrible job of eradicating and subduing nonbelievers and living up to these verses none of them came close to isis literalism christians have actually been much more successful historically at wiping out other religions and minority groups like the theodosian edict of or the wendish prussian crusades the cathars given the choice jews and minority christians like the nestorians universally chose to emigrate to muslim lands over christian europe they believed and found that muslim lands were more hospitable to practicing their beliefs than europe in fact jews were actually involved in promoting the muslim invasion of visigothic spain so frustrated they were at the abuses of the christians agree that there is little we non-muslims can do it not our job or place to guide the reformation and change within religion that is not our own however keep in mind that islam is nowhere near as simplistic or as monolithic as you claim there are forces we would find embody form of islam we find palatable as well as forces that embody an islam we find horrendous it just up to them and time to see how they resolve this religious struggle	0
well first off you are certainly free to google those quotes found them in various new articles reporting on muslim responses and then confirmed them on the organizations websites the statements are not in dispute they actually happened your scenario will say is flawed in that do not think the muslim world is what should be debated here we are talking about muslim citizens of the us not muslims in other countries and not non-citizens it the conflation of us muslims with all muslims worldwide that think is an unfair mode of assessment would agree that the wider muslim world even in my opinion has not done enough but think that muslim citizens in the us have done quite bit and do not see it as the prerogative of us muslims either to get muslims in other countries to do more or to be held responsible for the action or inaction of muslims in other countries do you would argue that one cannot hold muslims who have made statement held press conference and posted it to their website and media responsible for the wider media coverage and exposure of that statement do you think they can easily control coverage not to mention that most people news consumption is generated by feeds based on their interests this means that articles that may discuss these statements will not emerge in an individual news feed additionally if people only get their news from select and limited sites they may be unlikely to encounter articles that mention these statements finally statement from an organization on tragedy is certainly far less sensationalistic news so of course its not as emphasized as more dramatic narratives partially blame the media and partially blame the nature of news consumption today don think that if you personally haven heard about it that you should then blame those who have made the statement for being secretive the poll that you suggest think would say that most americans feel the muslim world has not done enough some of this is media presence some of this is simply bias or personal dislike some is fear and anxiety some is the conviction that all muslims are inherently deceptive and can never be trusted no matter what they do ve asked lot of people what muslims could do to satisfy and allay their concerns most people said they never could do anything lot of this is conflating us muslims with muslims around the world and refusing to identify muslims here as real americans denying them their citizenship already clear indication that they are on the side of the west else they would live in another country and identifying them as foreigners which they are not if they are citizens be pissed if people told me that even if my family had been in the us for or years my religion made me un-american and foreign jewish and that definitely happened to my parents and grandparents can identify with that frustration can understand why conflating them with members of their religion around the world and holding them responsible for others behavior is frustrating mean jews were considered part of some secret cabal to destroy the west at the beginning of the th century won do that to another people another part is that people don understand how divided islam really is and see all muslims as some monolithic force with single goal working in concert that is certainly ill-informed and lacks real understanding of how us muslims differ from those in other countries and from each other people talk about sharia and believe all muslims follow it as law code in its entirety indeed most muslims do observe the ritual rules that govern religious practice that are in sharia most in the us do not observe the civil code yet for most americans sharia means only civil code of ancient laws they have no idea its also where the ritual laws are that govern prayer fasting washing study eating additionally americans tend to mentally make muslim practice more orthodox in their minds than is really the case assuming all muslims are literalists orthodox believers strictly pious and completely committed to religion look at any religion shows you the vast majority of members are not particularly orthodox and the same is true with islam series of misconceptions simplifications and severe lack of honest critical knowledge is what mostly would shape this poll coupled with distinct lack of publicity for muslim activities that do oppose terrorism	0
think you missed my point christianity golden rule is to love your neighbor and jesus brought and taught peace disagree with the potus that isis is some radical wing they are literal wing adhering to mohamed teaching and own actions if the moderate muslims get literal with the quran then the world is in trouble islam needs major revision to the doctrine of the quran and not reformation to its original teaching my fear is that the islamic literalists will move moderates to their side once they perceive caliphate on the rise	0
more legislation yeah that ll fix it sarc for the literalists	0
the wahhabis are most often accused of being the qur anic purists and literalists their translations are the correct ones	0
yeah mean seriously ben biblical literalists meaning take historical texts like genesis exodus as true historical narratives but there is nothing about grain being stored in pyramids they may not have been tombs either actually but why such huge solid building to store grain this is part of the problem with off shoots like sda which elevate their founding prophets to biblical status don know where he got this but it strange that said still vote for him if liked his stances on issues	0
not the same thing how old the earth is re bible literalists vs evolution etc and questions like that are largely matter of belief or lack thereof supporting the rule of law as in not rewarding law breakers for come here illegally is policy issue in the here and now real world it matters what the people who candidate surrounds himself with believe regarding every day real world policies	0
any christian or jew for that matter who hates jews is in grave error and is in peril for his soul as per genesis we born again christians are bible literalists and we recognize that replacement theology is unbiblical bunkum viva israel	0
it is hilarious how leftist suddenly become intellectual literalists when it suits their ideology or current trolling opportunity	0
it is hilarious how leftist suddenly become intellectual literalists when it suits their ideology or current trolling opportunity	0
the issue is collective guilt do you believe in assigning collective guilt to group of people based on your or part of group interpretation of their scripture do not people are individuals you wouldn want to be characterized as the most orthodox or extreme member of any group you belong to are you willing to extend the same to others take muslims as individuals what benefit is there to assuming you know all about an individuals personal beliefs and ideas because of your conception of their religion or ideology not all christians are dominionists not all muslims are radical why assume an individual you meet embodies the worst or most dangerous parts of their religion why assume they must be orthodox believers in their scripture most people of any religion have met are not devoutly faithful literalists and that includes muslims that have met in the us and overseas when serving find the whole approach ridiculous ve seen radical muslims firsthand and can say that every muslim in fact the majority of them are not radical at all people are individuals don judge them as collective especially as someone who doesn really understand how complex their religion is	0
it an obvious deduction to make that cutting muslims welfare entitlements results in increasing support among muslims for the genocidal islamic literalists of the islamic state	0
this is hardly the first time mohamed elibiary was national security adviser and by some accounts associated with shukri abu baker former president of the holy land foundation which was found guilty of funding terrorists the muslim brotherhood spelled all of this out in manifesto made it abundantly clear that their objective was to destroy western civilization from within using civilization jihad muslim brotherhood ideology is antithetical to western society and traditions sharia is the ultimate goal we may scoff at the idea but western europe is falling beneath crushing demographic shift the muslim brotherhood is an an intolerant absolutists organization which seeks to impose medieval theocracy muslim extremists are actually just the orthodoxy they are literalists they ask themselves what would allah do and he was pretty explicit this is why gays are murdered by being thrown off buildings beheadings crucifixions read the atlantic article what isis really wants graeme wood has been interviewed and provides unambiguous accounts of what islamists say they want you may not believe they can achieve what they are striving for but make no mistake what their motivations are and that they see it as their obligation to try	0
all muslims are literalists	0
you know this pope is leftist dunce but see you hanging around here often spewing your fundamentalist bible-crazy condemnations of the catholic church in general let me take this opportunity to inform you that while this country definitely needs conservatives it doesn need self-righteous sectarian cult-minded fundamentalists like you that what the muslim literalists do when they worship their book of scribblings you think your recent and very made-up version of christianity or christ himself is so superior to everyone else that you publicly call the roman catholic church whore you doubtlessly think your bible tells you so that your bible says something to that effect to you that you are only relaying the infallible words of god himself well let me you something that kind of sanctimony is pretty rich coming from someone who calls the catholic church whore because honey you and others like you use the bible to make yourselves into infallible little popes you re hypocrite and while your conservative values and support of trump are certainly appreciated your despicable fundamentalist-driven defamation of the entire catholic faith is cheap and crazy this isn the place for defaming conservative american christians whose theological head thoughts are not exactly the same as your sure-to-be-infallible head thoughts	0
any witnesses would be years old so of course they already be dead what disqus_vgin joy disqus does not understand is that no one at the time wrote anything down except the emperor historians for the emperor they thought jesus was to create new king-dom and wipe out rome there was no need to write anything down it was all happening immediately it wasn until jesus was gone and the disciples started going that their followers started to think we better write some of this down or it will be forgotten the writers were not witnesses to nor participants in anything they wrote rd or nd hand hearsay at best whatever of any writings was collected and shuffled or shred in the by constantine and all for simplicity and power not authenticity accuracy honesty consistency and the clue from the beginning of the modern calendar that the world would not end at puts paid to why no one wrote anything god was supposed to come real soon now years later the gyrations of literalists and god s-word-ists are quite amazing and entertaining we just need to keep them out of power and influence because for them the world did end in	0
nooooo the key issues we need to focus on in the us are gun control and transgenderism obviously anyone who says otherwise is bigoted unsophisticate the right wingers just need little more time to come in line with the way things are for all you literalists this was joke don need emails accusing me of being troll	0
and what find curious about the carson quote bullet riddled body never worse than loss of gun rights is that gun controls far more restrictive than those we have now were embraced by the gop into the ronald reagan was all for gun control in ca as long as one understood that we were keeping guns out of the hands of blacks now the implication is that we need guns to keep us safe from threats read blacks muslims and the mentally ill gun control in the us can be and is used to manipulate and divide the voting public for political advantage but for the naive nd amendment literalists this argument is all about power and money carson is oblivious the nra is after from its members and the gun industry has stoked fears of bad guys and obama to sell weapons and ammo why do we allow ourselves to be so effectively controlled this is what the matter with kansas writ national and large	0
although be delighted if it turns out that pigs indeed can fly am reminded of the great former house speaker john boehner famouse howl into the night from the house floor about obamacare no you can hell no you can the speaker was raging on behalf of his entire gop the sentiment remains only the viters can defeat it br br	0
see that the cheering for these poll watchers takes three forms br br it possible for there to be problems with the voting machines so aha there are problems with the voting machines so buy my books on the massive fraud with the voting machines br br think read something someplace about voter who committed fraud so there are millions of vote frauds so trumpy only doing what needs to be done br br voted for obama twice didn but that what the guy told me to say because it worked for all the other guys who said this but so turned off by the leftlibs and their millions of dead viters and this video saw that voting trump and you can trust the black president because you know how they are anyway the real violence is coming from the democrats br br good grief	0
viters elected republican majority mostly due to gerrymandering	0
bernie sanders seems like great guy with values that admire and like many voters find politics and the cast of characters in washington amp running for president sad to terrifying bernie yea coulda shoulda woulda but how about an article that talks about the humanity and goodness of hillary clinton that drives her to want to do good by kids minorities women all we read about is what damaged or flawed person she is don mean an article about her strength with certain viters but just something positive about her the ny times is one of my favorite sources but the love fest for bernie combined with the pounding on the clinton as having little to no redeeming qualities certainly has an impact too on how we view lady who could possibly be our st woman prez	0
loathe the current let psychoanalyze trump trend and loathe even more the notion of gently guiding the fat jerk supporters towards the sunlight of reason br br say argue with em say what you think refute their lies and nonsense and advance better stuff br br then show up and vote get others to show up and vote whup em like kansas viters whupped that loonbox tim huelskamp--and then use the victory to do better br br we have real problems nothing we can handle but real problems we have good reason to be angry with hillary clinton ties to big money br br but let not adore mussolini and let not think we re better than everybody else	0
her legacy is dead worse than carter and worse than clinton supporting obumer foreign policy is death wish for hillary and the united states of america go home hillary if never hear about you again it will be great day	1
she has backed obumer in everything he has done so if like him you will love her as resident of missouri we are quite sick of her throwing us under the bus she has turned out to be huge disapointment	1
hillbilly could go on live tv stab and kill the host with knife and nothing would happen and if they arrest they will blow it and utilize double jeopardy nothing will ever happen to her same with obumer everyone is bought and paid for period	1
mrs clinton campaign manager is even admitting that is trump gets the republican nomination then the republicans will win obumer and all the demos know this so this is why the nut job is out there claiming victory	1

thought to say the obumer admin will never allow justice to go after the clintons but at this point am not sure it matters he just might now obama is set and on course to do as much damage as possible to the us don think he gives rats a__ who comes after him as president and if the gop has their way it will be one of their own rinos which will be little difference	1
kid was voting when was swing on the front gate the clintons are the biggest a-holes and are just like obumer trying to destroy america we don need ur b-s telling us who is the good guys and bad guys go back and take care of ur own country because if hillary is elected president she will screw up the entire world	1
once again time and time again obumer proves to the as well the world he is in over his head	1
well being that obumer pushed to train muslim arab rebels who we has no clue who they are as we see isis using us equipment isis taking over iraq after removing the military either he is an idiot who is very much over his head or obumer don mind watching the world in servitude to islam	1
im not sure but obumer should know cause he is practicing terrorist	1
this didn start with obumer and it will not end with obumer either federal government has become an entity of its own and it has evolved into something that dose not seem to be of the values of what free country is don have the answers but something or some one or group needs to rein in this out of control monster if it is not already too late	1
mr obumer the only time that muslims were apart of american was when they were selling black africans to the euro and the states then we ended there trade on the civilized world markets and we no longer had any ties with islam till the st war in the philippines and that didn end so well for the muslims we ended there draconian rule there for some time where in the hell did he get his history lessons oh yeh he is liberal left facts and stats don mean anything just the content they want to push sorry forgot the logic and truth is nothing to this man nor the sheep who follow	1
let see obumer told us we would have reduction in our annual insurance cost have not seen that instead my insurance cost went up month three months ago now this bird is telling us step right up for in added tax you my friend will not have to pay those high cost private insurance premiums look at the money saving you and to top it all off the government is going to run it all and the fools in the audience applaud	1
translation obumer and the liberal democraps are taking lessons from castro how to containe and silent the oppositions to their socialistic ideas	1
wtf like this will not be an all liberal progressive anti american audience on all gun and speech fuc obumer and his gun control	1
dead votes bring these dumb azz in to office no live american voter would vote for low life biotch like him same goes for obumer lots of dead and illegal votes out there for these scum bags oh liberals fall into the dead voter category	1

actually approve disapprove of obumer according to cnn if you average all the polls his number is about over all but among working americans it is approval	1
wish this azzhole would just shut his rino mouth eat some donuts or something he lost all credibility after he just about swapped spit with obumer and gave senate set to the dems	1
sorry hillary the pass the buck blame game is getting old try owning mistake take some accountability that you your master and your power hungry party has done enough damage obumer and holder allowed black behavior matter mobs burn loot and destroy few towns and called them protestors now your little minions that you and your party have created by cramming false statements and truths to the education to narrative have created this from the left and now you and your party have lost control over the ignorant people you created these are your holders and obumers children from the orgy of lies you fed to the lower iq americans thus we now need more than ever strong leader to clean this mess up hopefully he can as well undo the and lies you have feed the last generations how dose it feel to know you have destroyed the lives of these americans who you manipulated to believe that every thing the and white men who created this country and government was evil and bad you are discusting tool selfserving lieing sub human there is place in hell just for you	1
liberal pollsters this far out are always going to lieee btw think there was few more if-if and it-it in obumer version lol	1
obumer will make this national holiday even tho ali became musloom to avoid the draft	1
obumer will make this national holiday even tho ali became musloom to avoid the draft	1
well if this hole has paid attention to the last years most people in the as well many of the reps don trust what obumer says from foreign to domestic he has been over his head and his policies are complete fail so we as people who can not trust the ceo and management of our country we as people need to hear it from the leaders out side of our country to really see what is going one	1
id luv to read obumer passed on in his sleep the same way the justice did	1
correct but much like yr old they have no clue that they are cutting their own noses off their face and once they find that their actions did in fact screwed them selves they will tell you that was exactly planed and it is working so well that removing your nose you can breath and smell so much better but while they have convinced their followers to cut their noses off their leaders will not nor have their families to do so much like obumer care	1
obumer in pants suit	1
at least ben is think african american unlike obama hey they could have said all that time that obumer is the first mulatto president and woulda been accurate just not pc just what is pc for half-breed bi-racial	1
ok libtard so you can write see you on september th and if trump doesn win it will because you to voted us with illegals and dead people that how think obumer got elected do agree he is hear to stay the nerve you libs have bringing up anything sex related when you have the gay blaze dim running for president and slick willie the first wife who we know has done all of the things that you mention about trump and nothing was proven except that these women were disbursed by the dims	1
not so much the military but the state army national guard units are the key component of any opposition by obumer to initiate gun confiscation order should revolution occur because of his complete dis-regard for the constitution bill of rights remember officers and enlisted men of all branches take an oath to defend the constitution not barrrrry insane this is one law signed as legislation by barrrry would certainly be overreach and consequences would be extreme bloody revolution to finally rid america of liberalism	1
that is the job of the prez to unite and governoren and serve all americans not select few some one just didn let obumer that is what prez job is this current prez has done more damage to this country foreign and domestic than any country or terrorist could have ever done he also isolated the black americans good job obumer you may be the worst in history	1
they have often said including obumer that the american public is stupid and they will never notice or speak up how corrupt they are jail them all	1
if is up to obumer we would all use the left hand	1
true the real manchurian candidate is the less seen valerie jarrett she his puppet master born in iran muslim former slum lord from chicago who met the obumer community organizer she lived in the family quarters at the white house not sure if she still does but wouldn be surprised guess it true muslims do have more than one wife	1
obuma does not represent the majority of american people the pos obumer is as anti american as isis	1
agree keep assad and get rid of the troublemakers obumer crooked hillary and herman munster juhn kerry	1

great news libby you just won the th annual obumer state dumbazz award	1
it makes no difference cruz isnt eligible either nor was obumer but the powers that be will never stop the two cubans from participating no matter how many court cases there are and in light of all the evidence proving there ineligibility this only proves more so that the whole thing is fraud and fixed by the establishment thus pushing more people to trump trump	1
just like the shaw during carter obumer is just following the democraps legacy of turning your backs on your allies	1
lear should take his middle finger and shove it up his azz obumer has exposed his middle finger to america more than any president in history	1
do they is that so have you ever wondered why every left liberal democrap tell not only black americans that they can get by with out constant help can understand how to vote can pass high school lower the standard they need welfare they are victims they need government assistants on every aspect that is sad and disgusting they are very capable they are not victims they are warriors they are not retarded they can think for them selves when applied away from the mindset of helplessness that is bombarded on them from the likes of al sharpton erick holder obumer jessy and every liberal democrap they are the true raciest who look down on black americans if you want true equality and forever leave the victimhood that the left has made many believe then lean more to the right	1
obumer told her to pick the muslim luving pos or else	1
muslim luving pos obumer is	1
nothing quiet like the left democraps ya obumer is week funny they never complained or argue that but he black and to say he is this is offensives who ever said that the word black it the new taboo word for well black people needs to be slapped just another attempt to restrict free speech liberals hate free speech it seems has been killing the st amendments for decades	1
ive said year ago that eu will fall apart the fine people of britain have just took major part of the foundation away from the soros merkel and obumer clusterfuc of muslim domination of europe	1

have many friends in law enforcement including border patrol and they all tell me the same thing they are forced to second guess themselves contrary to their training thanks to obumer it getting them killed	1
have many friends in law enforcement including border patrol and they all tell me the same thing they are forced to second guess themselves contrary to their training thanks to obumer it getting them killed	1

good job obumer	1
why would obumer want to destroy organization that he created and supplied some to the best weapons in the world too that would seem to be waste	1
republicans stood by when obumer passed unconstitutional laws republicans passed your budget republicans stood by when the health care passed republicans stood by when you drew your invisible red line in syria republicans failed their elected promises to the voters voters have had enough the party have pushed the voters to their limits we want america we once knew back we trample on your political correctness we are tired of corruption and race baiting	1
my brother just moved to czech republic says he will not return to the us till obumer is gone he said there is no support for the mooslim with the common people of europe	1

and obumer wants this shiet for america well fuc him and all his muslim trash	1
its been that way for some time but with this administration unlike many before him obumer and his crew in the white house seem to either not care or they think americans are gullible as north koreans to believe the crap they attempt to feed he people washington on nearly every level from the time obumer has been elected seem to have dropped in the total of iq points both side of the isle they both bicker and piss on us all and don have the decency to call it rain	1
this from an avowed communist he and his ilk and radical muslims need to be shown the door at the point of gun would be just fine obumer and his entire administration included	1
but it is ok to call every white person slave owner and raciest and never mention that it was white men who ended slavery on the world markets it was white men who bestowed equal rights yet it seems the majority of black americans hate us for it my guess is between the left liberals re-writing history and the under-educated who believe anything they are spoon fed are quick to hate and use liberal tactics such as name calling when real conversation or debate dose not go their way such as words of raciest and nazi this in many cases ends any meaningful conversation the silver lining is between the al sharpton and the so called black behavior should matter or uh live should matter the raciest is loosing its sting what is un-american is the inability to assimilate to become american and the liberals left who support this either visit and leave or become an american if people are unwilling to become an american and share our values that all men and women are equal and should be judged by merit not by race or beliefs and these beliefs are not filled with intolorance hate to other people and beliefs have no room nor business being in the west thanks to obumer and the left never have my self in my life nor any time since the civil war have we seen our country so divided while am for free speech no matter how much disagree or how offensive find it will fight for that person or persons to speak their mind but to preach hate to kill destroy this country and people from the police to the american citizen should not be tolerated by any one as for the ones who call them selves american and would rather change this country to my way or death are not american and should and must have any form showing that they are citizen stripped and returned to place of origin and for the ones who may too slow to pick up that am speaking of islam from what see and hear and the lack of hearing find that by their traditional beliefs there is nor room for such crap in any country that promotes freedom and liberty to all men and women none	1
according to us code section it is crime to cross state lines to incite rioting punishable by up to years in prison but do you think the obumer administration and loreta lurch will enforce this	1
hey mr trump with you but fear obumer knows exactly what he is doing and there lies the really danger to our society	1
hey every one want to be the best and no at something obumer is just the no at being the worst	1

well at least romney didn have to pay people to attend his rallies and neither did obumer	1
it the that gets some type of free stuff and the same idiots that elected obumer twice	1
probably paid off to back down against obumer	1
you are just like the rest of libtards when you only argument to throw people off with insults your obumer is snake with smooth talk and little to show for showing up for meeting at mosque raided by the fbi while skipping the sc justice scalia funeral given speech at nelson mandala for minutes and didnt bother to stay at scalia viewing for more than minutes that is not respect incurring millions in tax payer moneys for his vacations for the past years why not its free money run up this country debt to almost trillions and you are bragging about counting your dough hope and change my a$$ never more is this country more divisive on races income inequality and the shrinking of middle class while his corporate masters are lining their pocket with money resulting from his trade deals tpp and spending omnibus you should more informed about that fraud before babbling on more praise for that motherf cker sellout	1
iserial knows if any thing that may get done you don want to go to obumer the next best bet would be going straight to the reps of this country besides washington leadership under obumer are far form being leaders the world do see them as joke and week depends who ya ask but very few see them on the world stage as true leaders	1
obumer is now on extreme mission of hate	1
call them the dc bombers with obumer their coach	1
here is the cost per year for every man women and child in the so family of four just multiply by this cost is yours weather you have insurence or not is the cost per year for each person so family of four pays now you have those who do not pay taxes so guess who picks up that share the people who pay taxes so now double the amount above at best so the affordable health care act is only affordable for those who pay no federal income taxes all you young people got this one on your back you all voted in large numbers for obumer so you get to pay this for the rest of your lives sorry about that	1
this dim wit is missing the point thanks to the current administration has had deep wedge in race relations the in my life time have not ever seen to label people is to divide people but will say that obumer and holder has isolated american blacks its not just black white its black vs latino black vs asian black vs jew black vs white ect and now we hear the cries and screams of outfits such as the black kittens or uh panthers for race war ok well if ya want to but if these idiots stayed in school they would find that they are out numbered and out gunned at least let alone black with the mind set such as this are not known for maintaining there guns let alone having legal fire arms thus many will find that there guns will jam and misfire and perhaps blow up in their own hands but like said if idiots want one ok go ahead	1
suppose you prefer the weak child king we have in the wh now yes am sure that putin trembles at the thoughts at negotiating with the boy king putin plays chess and obumer plays marbles	1
as long as obumer and his cronies are in power sorry nothing will happen get republican in power in the wh you may just get what you need	1

try obumer for treason now remove him before he can do further damage to the nation	1
nothing will get done under obumer when it comes to need to flex your military and political muscles he has no back bone and will only bully people who can not defend his attacks such as the american people	1
would honor him and obumer if they committed suicide	1
now who does obumer own to take boners job	1
lol ya sure my checks look good but the cost of living with kids sure can wipe it out at least not dodging motor rounds or stuck in room with obumer or any one in his administration	1
as soon as we elect trump and jail obumer and the hildabeast	1
they are the black kittens farrakhan al sharpton the fbi is waiting to move after obumer and his lap dogs are out to do other wise would be pointless	1
they are keeping track and tabs as long as obumer is there with his lap dogs the fbi and hls won bother because they know it would be pointless just wait for the next man or woman comes into power things are going to get ugly for the likes of them the new black kittens farrakhan as well to al sharpton	1
race war would be the end of black americans between out numbered and out gunned by whites they would find that the asians and latino would not just sit and watch the attempt of the destruction of what they came hear for we should thank obumer and holder for isolating black americans suppose but no one said that black americans pass math classes in high school either in large numbers	1

black behavior should matter is by product much like obumer from an old soviet plan look up the name anna chapman do some digging what she and her comrads were doing to the west for yrs and look around what the west has become what created the greatest threat to the free world not just the this dose not come from foreign military not from race nor religion it is political correctness when facts and stats become taboo and leaders ignore and make terrible decision based on emotion not logic black behavior should matter has made criminals into heroes and heroes into criminals obumer has isolated black americans fighting the asians latino and of course the very people who ended their slavery and bestowed them not only equal rights but rights greater than their own and they hate them us for it have no empathy nor guilt for the ignorant black american none america did at one time did attempt to give black americans land whole country on their own see the history of liberia well it didn go so well and became the very thing the scream and cry about here if more black americans could pass high school perhaps more would stand up and tell their so called leaders that hey stop your full of crap america is not out to get us look around at the world we are american not african ya lot to wish for but we don see this confusion with identity with other races nor cultures perhaps give them land one more time and keep track do not ignore history this time in the allied countries were drafting new counties for the jews to call home many were displaced and no one wanted them as we know the final place was of coarse israel but there was one draft carved out chunk of land on the boader of texas new mexico arizona and mexico say dust off them plans and let black americans run it on their own	1
this won happen obumer needs something from killary and bill killary knows that too much will come out with any trial so the socialist puppet told the racist running the just us department to make up some false charges soon killary and bill will make the criminal in the white house deal to keep the general silent and all this will go away or be covered up	1
bet cause they are as crooked the obumer administration do not trust thing they say	1
black lives don matter not to blacks self ignorance is the biggest issue with black americans from crying the white men owned black slaves well ok ya so did every one white men did not go to africa to round up slaves they were sold by the people who cornered the world trade market in slavery and that were arabic muslims slavery has been around before white men existed white men did not start slavery but we did end it in this country and still fighting it if the majority of black americans spend more time reading real history books even better old journals they would loose there minds due to every thing that they have been spoon fed is not true and holds very little if any merit such as president davis of the confederacy with was black just like obumer she was white black most black americans personally know don follow the rest of the black sheep all families are rather discussed and embarrassed by the black lives movement as well they bury their heads every time al sharp tons face appears on the don blame them told them too want to burry my head when he is on as well	1
that obvious you don care that why your idol obumer will receive an f- for the his presidency and the supreme honor of beating out jimmy carter as worst president so thanks for pointing that out	1

thanks to the current administration they turned ferguson into cult film that reminds me of escape from ny escape from ferguson this is what happens when people pretend to be something they are not obumer holder you are not helping what holder calls his people the comment alone show the they want division of the people of the this is not quality of great leader but one who wishes to destroy nation turn the people on each other this is nothing less than inticing hate and riots as we can see let alone promoting cop killing and lawlessness	1
my hope of turning or at least stopping the complete fail of america is gone the republican leadership is just obumer in disguise if holder in skirt is nominated we are screwed	1
what nut sack this guy the only ones fighting isis and this jersy assclown what to shoot down the good guy in the fight might as well work for the obumer administration	1

anyone that does not believe this was not set by the obumer administration is crazy way to much on the line for iran imho this was done to show america that iran will cooperate with america threw the state department to prop up the iran deal the more that comes out the more it sounds way to fishy not to be setup	1
this is just an extention of obumers polociy the term was used in some black behavior should matter gatherings and now used in obumer military policy hands up and don shoot with the current lack of leadership in washington for the last yrs our allies don nor can depend on the lines in the sand and countries and people not friendly to the are having the time of their lives	1
what about after he wipes out obumer unconstitutional executive orders he will just replace it with his own	1
wanna bet what do you think mr trump will do based on what you know now when things stop going his way do you think he will execute his office within the confines of the constitution or just rule by fiat like obumer has done the man has no humility	1
of course imho was planned ahead by our pos president and iran to show americans that we can have peaceful dialog with iran obumer has to many flags against him and he is deceitful enough to pull this off	1
and under the orders of the obumer administration to make america look weak	1

the terrorist organization called cair is nothing but obumer front for immigration of mooslim terrorists the american people should demand that cair be shutdown and all moolims affiliated with cair deported asap	1

think the majority of americans of all races are beginning to understand that the us will not survive another chaotic lawless democrap rule trump is the leader for law and order is not raciest it is what any civilized man woman or child would want to live in no matter what race black americans tier of being looked at as thug they are reaching out for real leadership and all that comes running in to scream will save you for the last yrs are nothing less than glory hounds race baiter haters and power hungry money glutting slime balls yes sadly obumer falls into this but from the time the dallas massacre it seems more real black american men are yelling above the old black leaders enough its not cop on black its not white against black it is us my self while have heard this before it was only from one or and then they are forgotten and at times found dead weeks later just in one weekend ive seen and heard this from different black men from police preachers rapper that surprised me to say the least and quiet few community organizers who said black lives matter group is not welcome on our streets yes black men and women did say this feel with this sad it took the lives of several police officers but black americans as whole may be waking up they have been used for too long by liberals and the left democraps they need to discover this them selves and with the death of these officers more black leaders are pushing the race baiter haters aside and perhaps just maybey the black behavior matter group as well such people like the black kittens will be exposed and ostracized as the kkk as have and let these groups hate each other in privet and to them selves	1

do you know who the current secretary is put in place by the democrast it jack lew if someone wanted to publish hack job articles about people done wrong by citi group during the financial crisis they be writing them from now until eternity why didnt that appointment send dems into voting republican	0
going to try to approach this without bias since you seem unable to and have some inherent hatred for democrast the republican party and the democratic party of today didn really form until probably coolidge who was one of the first republican presidents to consistently and outwardly voice more support for businesses from this point on we saw this divide further cement itself as presidents like woodrow wilson and fdr expanded the reach of the federal government and presidents like reagan sought to lower taxes it wasn an exact mirror of the parties today but we started to see them as the parties of restricted government versus an involved government obviously this was more cemented with jfk lbj nixon and bush things that were synonymous with the presidencies of obama and bush social issues foreign policy are probably transient pieces of their respective parties the parties are constantly re-aligning hell in years the democratic party might be conservative and the republican party might be liberal who are you going to hate then	0

can you affirm the self evident truths of the declaration of independence moreover the rest of the decl is absolutely contrary to all leftist political ideologies god is the reason for our rights and freedoms as stated in the decl not gov maybe you need to re-read the decl are you in the wrong country north korea socialist communist utopia can always use more workers we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness	0

here is the inherent problem the constitution was not devised to fix problems everyone wants to fix problems the constitution restrains lawmakers from fixing things it says basically fix things if you must but do not cross this line or you will make it worse we have unimaginative leaders who represent simpletons who cannot imagine fix that doesn trample on someone why do we have constitution decl ind in the first place because we didn like the way parliament was fixing things england may have had legitimate reason or not for fighting continental wars they were in debt legit problem how did they try to fix it on the backs of hard working colonists who had nothing to do with the war more or less the constitution encourages to think deeper than the tyrants of old it is not for the lazy minded which is pretty much all we have today	0

which is why he is sidling up to casich	0
paul is the only candidate that makes sense on the issues and talks about your privacy has common sense foreign policy and has schooled all the other candidates at one time or another the establishment along with their msm have way of taking the best candidates off of voters list they been doing this for years and years that why we end up with inferior presidents they been trying to push rand of the main stage since the start in favor of bush christie fiorina casich and carson	0
rand paul compromised politician only to the deaf dumb and blind we missed out on chance to elect the best president of our lifetime and you sound happy about it we are now stuck with an empty suit in trump canadian that bought and payed for by goldman sachs in cruz but the cruz people refuse to see it the way it is an establishment rino in casich socialist and sociopath at this point ll take my chances with the empty suit but talking like that about paul only shows how much some people have been brainwashed by the msm	0
because it was paul they wanted out from the beginning the reason they kept florina in this long is because they couldn screw paul by himself it would be too obvious paul is polling better that casich jeb and christie	0
in most polls paul has been polling higher that jed christy and casich he been in sixth and fifth place go figure	0
first of all never claimed that cruz is perfect and that have zero issues with some things he done because do matter of fact my reply had nothing to do with me liking disliking anyone have huge problem with cruz signing the corker bill which levin was the first to point out how it was flip flopping the treatise clause and its intent had huge problem with cruz signing tpp initially he later voted against it and also retracted his stuff question is trump the only one allowed to flip on policies btw levin has been outspoken and questions cruz on this re-read my reply it has nothing to do with cruz and his policy views it has to with you trumpsters willing to throw scalia rush levin anyone that is critical of trump you pointed out trump took out carson have no problem with that as long as it done on facts policy and without character assassination that what liberals do his whole intent is to win after all in regards to crony capitalism who do you think first started using that phrase long before anyone else mark levin he been as outspoken about it probably more so than anyone because it goes against what he believes fundamentally makes this republic tic true capitalism please tell me what the principles of this new populist movement are is it intolerance and complete disregard of the past what are they is there name for it the tea party suppose we should eviscerate them too because they ve liked cruz in the past sounds like another movements principles can think of liberalism to throw away scalia levin and rush great contributions to conservatism and this country in general for primary election is dumb also like to point out something would gladly vote for trump if he gets the nomination there is only couple be disgusted enough not to vote for rubio casich and jeb do know one thing for sure if your populist movement doesn vote for cruz and conservatives don for trump hilary wins	0
last time checked he was in fifth ahead of florina casich christie bush and one point behind fourth place the polls of who won the last debate had him in third behind trump who did nothing to win the debate and cruz do you find it realistic that carson is ahead of him don believe everything that comes out of selected person polls back in some of my friends voted for mccain because they didn think ron paul had chance if all those people that did that voted for paul the outcome might have been different the outcome of voting for someone other than the person that you find to be the best candidate because of the polls historically has never turned out good	0
when started out was in this exact order trump cruz carson supporter carson seemed to be decent man but was too timid for the job in my opinion cruz favoring the visa increases and his wife connections to the cfr and goldman sachs killed the deal so trump was my man but unlike many trump supporters went back and researched his immigration policy which was why originally supported him and was absolutely shocked by what found his quotes and it was as recent as last summer and last december that why screwed on candidate remember defending donald recently regarding david duke and on the nd amendment yet if dare share what found regarding his position on amnesty called liar or cruzbot think it grave mistake for supporters to follow any candidate blindly and chant their candidate campaign slogan whether it trump cruz rubio casich clinton or sanders that how we got obama	0
alex marlow trump can talk about his penis size if he wants to be president agree so f-ing sick of this bs get on topic and act like president trump you have my support and ll vote for you but this bs has to stop rubio and casich are toast it you and cruz to battle it out the same goes for cruz your hitman beck and his bs with hitler talk needs to be dealt with from cruz if you cruz say nothing about this guess he ok with it	0
trump was the only candidate that mantioned tpp in the previous march debate by the way the trans-pacific if you look at the tpp total disaster which by the way marco is in favor of they need it is disaster for our country only trump mentioned it but suddenly cruz casich and rubio are on the bandwagon	0

this happens every time none establishment candidate runs for president they show you the polls that they created and put it in your mine who is viable candidate and who not of course they ll include few scrubs as in casich christie and the such just to dilute the field and that how we end up with the lesser of the two evils if reagan was running today he be right where rand is	0

so you re still buying the story that osama bin laden orchestrated the whole attack did too until started reading about who owned the just two month-old year lease on the wtc when it was destroyed also who specifically issued that lease and who the security outfit was supposedly protecting the wtc at the time what the wtc was insured for what amount was paid to the lease-holder after the attack and who presided over the legal proceedings that made the ruling forcing the insurance company to cough up over billion then there was the revelation that because of the use of asbestos insulation when built the removal of which would cost more than the appraised value of the buildings the structures were essentially worthless then started reading about thermite charges and the science of building destruction by demolition crews then there unexplainable tumbling down of the untouched third wtc building the evidence doesn stop there either not pointing any fingers regarding you ll notice just tossing out clues that person with touch more than average intelligence and little bit of curiosity might look into	0

you mean like lying about wmd to go to war in iraq americans know the truth they support and condone what their government does once the government internalizes this fascism on their own people which they are starting to do thats when the american people will realise what price they will have to pay for their inhumanity in every sovereign nation targeted by the us for destabilization and regime change as recently in ukraine venezuela and syria among other nations the us-nato secret security and intelligence forces have trained mercenary snipers on using the false flag tactic by posing as enemy personnel and murdering their own citizens as well as police back in february in both ukraine and venezuela during the weeks leading up to the us-nato supported ukrainian fascist coup and the violent unrest in venezuela snipers shot and killed protesters in the streets in both situations the cold-blooded killing was designed to turn public sentiment against the alleged oppressive government security forces that were being falsely blamed then in both nations photos were quickly posted on social media websites to inflame citizens to openly oppose and actively overthrow their existing government which of course with us backing did occur in ukraine the fact is the us has always had al qaeda on its payroll spanning the last twenty-five years for over three years al qaeda mercenaries have been active in both libya and syria fighting us proxy wars for regime changes in libya against the overthrow of muammar kaddafi and in what now appears to be losing cause in syria to overthrow bashar al-assad therefore it should not come as much of surprise that the us government merely used osama bin laden and his al qaeda to be the patsies in false flag operation to launch the war on terror on the false pretext of invading afghanistan and iraq	0

he didn make illegal immigration major issue obama did by causing the crisis it was an issue in and would have been bigger issue in this election regardless of trump involvement trump just shouted the loudest and has offered no credible solutions if anything his absurd proposals and abrasive rhetoric has made the issue toxic and more difficult to address rationally now everyone has to compete with his inane ramblings now he is saying he wants those guest worker programs he was initially railing against and he even includes plan to expedite the re-entry of people he deports so his plan is to spend billions of dollars rounding everyone up housing them trying them transporting them to their country of origin then give them pass to skip to the front of line to get back in he did not predict he predicted an unspecified attack of some sort and so did bunch of other people everyone knew osama bin laden was planning to attack the us on our own soil he said so publicly for years as for his attacks on women don really care that he seems to target women more aggressively or more often and don care if they said something rude to him first tell my four year old son this and he gets it you cannot control other people words or actions you can only control how you respond his response is typically juvenile petty and crude that speaks more to his character than those he berates even worse than all of that he is bumbling incoherent mess if you actually read his words rather than listen to him speak it becomes even more clear he speaks in jumbled word salad of slogans and populist catchphrases that make no sense here is just one example from recent speech on the iran nuke deal read this and then tell me these are the words of man with insight and intellect look having nuclear my uncle was great professor and scientist and engineer dr john trump at mit good genes very good genes ok very smart the wharton school of finance very good very smart you know if you re conservative republican if were liberal if like ok if ran as liberal democrat they would say one of the smartest people anywhere in the world it true but when you re conservative republican they try oh do they do number that why always start off went to wharton was good student went there went there did this built fortune you know have to give my like credentials all the time because we re little disadvantaged but you look at the nuclear deal the thing that really bothers me it would have been so easy and it not as important as these lives are nuclear is powerful my uncle explained that to me many many years ago the power and that was years ago he would explain the power of what going to happen and he was right who would have thought but when you look at what going on with the four prisoners now it used to be three now it four but when it was three and even now would have said it all in the messenger fellas and it is fellas because you know they don they haven figured that the women are smarter right now than the men so you know it gonna take them about another years but the persians are great negotiators the iranians are great negotiators so and they they just killed they just killed us	0

putin may be bad man but he way more rational than the mullahs he knows that war with the united states isn winning situation but by funding iran and syria he has counterpoint to israel saudi arabia and others an irrational man is one that is out of control like osama bin laden because he guided not by reason but by ideology putin thinks in terms of what will help his country and his legacy which requires actions he knows he can get away with or that are almost unilaterally supported going to fight the islamic state is something any civilized nation would support but we know that by funding iran that it is merely laundering service for hezballoh and others this whole situation is dangerous but frankly is out of our hands for now	0

we are on their land it as simple as that there are many people in this nation oddly demanding we include their religion in their label it not hard to see that we are the ones provoking them most people still don know that osama bin laden was once our ally and that much of his reasons for attacking us were due to us betraying him after he helped overthrow the ussr in afghanistan this is all shoved away when people want to continue talking about the religion rather than the reasons we re here in the first place- nation building instead the gop candidate is back to talking about safezones in country we were never invited to be in nor have any business being involved in not speaking out against this will result in another age of neoconservative far worse than we ve seen in our time	0

the first command the moon god allah gave to the illiterate camel herher was read the quran quran and kill them wherever you find them and turn them out from where they have turned you out and al-fitnah disbelief or unrest is worse than killing but if they desist then lo allah is forgiving and merciful and fight them until there is no more fitnah disbelief and worshipping of others along with allah and worship is for allah alone but if they cease let there be no transgression except against az-zalimun the polytheists and wrong-doers etc translation is from the noble quran the historical context of this passage is not defensive warfare since muhammad and his muslims had just relocated to medina and were not under attack by their meccan adversaries in fact the verses urge offensive warfare in that muslims are to drive meccans out of their own city which they later did the use of the word persecution by some muslim translators is thus disingenuous the actual muslim words for persecution idtihad and oppression variation of z-l-m do not appear in the verse the actual arabic comes from fitna which can mean disbelief or the disorder that results from unbelief or temptation taken as whole the context makes clear that violence is being authorized until religion is for allah ie unbelievers desist in their unbelief quran then fight in the cause of allah and know that allah heareth and knoweth all things quran fighting is prescribed for you and ye dislike it but it is possible that ye dislike thing which is good for you and that ye love thing which is bad for you but allah knoweth and ye know not not only does this verse establish that violence can be virtuous but it also contradicts the myth that fighting is intended only in self-defense since the audience was obviously not under attack at the time from the hadith we know that this verse was narrated at time that muhammad was actually trying to motivate his people into raiding merchant caravans for loot quran as to those who reject faith will punish them with terrible agony in this world and in the hereafter nor will they have anyone to help quran soon shall we cast terror into the hearts of the unbelievers for that they joined companions with allah for which he had sent no authority this speaks directly of polytheists yet it also includes christians since they believe in the trinity ie what muhammad incorrectly believed to be joining companions to allah quran let those fight in the way of allah who sell the life of this world for the other whoso fighteth in the way of allah be he slain or be he victorious on him we shall bestow vast reward the martyrs of islam are unlike the early christians who were led meekly to the slaughter these muslims are killed in battle as they attempt to inflict death and destruction for the cause of allah this is the theological basis for today suicide bombers quran those who believe fight in the cause of allah quran they but wish that ye should reject faith as they do and thus be on the same footing as they but take not friends from their ranks until they flee in the way of allah from what is forbidden but if they turn renegades seize them and slay them wherever ye find them and in any case take no friends or helpers from their ranks quran not equal are those believers who sit at home and receive no hurt and those who strive and fight in the cause of allah with their goods and their persons allah hath granted grade higher to those who strive and fight with their goods and persons than to those who sit at home unto all in faith hath allah promised good but those who strive and fight hath he distinguished above those who sit at home by special reward this passage criticizes peaceful muslims who do not join in the violence letting them know that they are less worthy in allah eyes it also demolishes the modern myth that jihad doesn mean holy war in the quran but rather spiritual struggle not only is the arabic word used in this passage but it is clearly notreferring to anything spiritual since the physically disabled are given exemption the hadith reveals the context of the passage to be in response to blind man protest that he is unable to engage in jihad and this is reflected in other translations of the verse quran and be not weak hearted in pursuit of the enemy if you suffer pain then surely they too suffer pain as you suffer pain is pursuing an injured and retreating enemy really an act of self-defense quran the punishment of those who wage war against allah and his messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is only this that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned this shall be as disgrace for them in this world and in the hereafter they shall have grievous chastisement quran will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them no reasonable person would interpret this to mean spiritual struggle quran ye who believe when ye meet those who disbelieve in battle turn not your backs to them whoso on that day turneth his back to them unless maneuvering for battle or intent to join company he truly hath incurred wrath from allah and his habitation will be hell hapless journey end quran and fight with them until there is no more fitna disorder unbelief and religion should be only for allah some translations interpret fitna as persecution but the traditional understanding of this word is not supported by the historical context see notes for the meccans were simply refusing muhammad access to their city during haj other muslims were allowed to travel there just not as an armed group since muhammad had declared war on mecca prior to his eviction the meccans were also acting in defense of their religion since it was muhammad intention to destroy their idols and establish islam by force which he later did hence the critical part of this verse is to fight until religion is only for allah meaning that the true justification of violence was the unbelief of the opposition according to the sira ibn ishaq hisham muhammad further explains that allah must have no rivals quran if thou comest on them in the war deal with them so as to strike fear in those who are behind them that haply they may remember quran it is not for prophet that he should have prisoners of war until he had made great slaughter in the land quran and let not those who disbelieve suppose that they can outstrip allah purpose lo they cannot escape make ready for them all thou canst of armed force and of horses tethered that thereby ye may dismay the enemy of allah and your enemy quran prophet exhort the believers to fight quran so when the sacred months have passed away then slay the idolaters wherever you find them and take them captive and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush then if they repent and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate leave their way free to them according to this verse the best way of staying safe from muslim violence is to convert to islam prayer salat and the poor tax zakat are among the religion five pillars this popular claim that the quran only inspires violence within the context of self-defense is seriously challenged by this passage as well since the muslims to whom it was written were obviously not under attack had they been then there would have been no waiting period earlier verses make it duty for muslims to fight in self-defense even during the sacred months the historical context is mecca after the idolaters were subjugated by muhammad and posed no threat once the muslims had power they violently evicted those unbelievers who would not convert quran fight against them so that allah will punish them by your hands and disgrace them and give you victory over them and heal the breasts of believing people humiliating and hurting non-believers not only has the blessing of allah but it is ordered as means of carrying out his punishment and even healing the hearts of muslims quran those who believe and have left their homes and striven with their wealth and their lives in allah way are of much greater worth in allah sight these are they who are triumphant the arabic word interpreted as striving in this verse is the same root as jihad the context is obviously holy war quran fight those who believe not in allah nor the last day nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by allah and his messenger nor acknowledge the religion of truth even if they are of the people of the book until they pay the jizya with willing submission and feel themselves subdued people of the book refers to christians and jews according to this verse they are to be violently subjugated with the sole justification being their religious status this was one of the final revelations from allah and it set in motion the tenacious military expansion in which muhammad companions managed to conquer two-thirds of the christian world in the next years islam is intended to dominate all other people and faiths quran and the jews say ezra is the son of allah and the christians say the messiah is the son of allah these are the words of their mouths they imitate the saying of those who disbelieved before may allah destroy them how they are turned away quran ye who believe what is the matter with you that when ye are asked to go forth in the cause of allah ye cling heavily to the earth do ye prefer the life of this world to the hereafter but little is the comfort of this life as compared with the hereafter unless ye go forth he will punish you with grievous penalty and put others in your place this is warning to those who refuse to fight that they will be punished with hell quran go forth light-armed and heavy-armed and strive with your wealth and your lives in the way of allah that is best for you if ye but knew see also the verse that follows if there had been immediate gain in sight and the journey easy they would all without doubt have followed thee but the distance was long and weighed on them this contradicts the myth that muslims are to fight only in self-defense since the wording implies that battle will be waged long distance from home in another country and on christian soil in this case according to the historians quran prophet strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be unyielding to them and their abode is hell and evil is the destination dehumanizing those who reject islam by reminding muslims that unbelievers are merely firewood for hell makes it easier to justify slaughter it also explains why today devout muslims have little regard for those outside the faith quran but the messenger and those who believe with him strive and fight with their wealth and their persons for them are all good things and it is they who will prosper quran allah hath purchased of the believers their persons and their goods for theirs in return is the garden of paradise they fight in his cause and slay and are slain promise binding on him in truth through the law the gospel and the quran and who is more faithful to his covenant than allah then rejoice in the bargain which ye have concluded that is the achievement supreme how does the quran define true believer quran you who believe fight those of the unbelievers who are near to you and let them find in you hardness quran and when we wish to destroy town we send our commandment to the people of it who lead easy lives but they transgress therein thus the word proves true against it so we destroy it with utter destruction note that the crime is moral transgression and the punishment is utter destruction before ordering the attacks osama bin laden first issued americans an invitation to islam quran this parable lays the theological groundwork for honor killings in which family member is murdered because they brought shame to the family either through apostasy or perceived moral indiscretion the story which is not found in any jewish or christian source tells of moses encountering man with special knowledge who does things which don seem to make sense on the surface but are then justified according to later explanation one such action is to murder youth for no apparent reason however the wise man later explains that it was feared that the boy would grieve his parents by disobedience and ingratitude he was killed so that allah could provide them better son note this is one reason why honor killing is sanctioned by sharia reliance of the traveler umdat al-saliq says that punishment for murder is not applicable when parent or grandparent kills their offspring quran we gave the good things of this life to these men and their fathers until the period grew long for them see they not that we gradually reduce the land in their control from its outlying borders is it then they who will win quran therefore listen not to the unbelievers but strive against them with the utmost strenuousness strive against is jihad obviously not in the personal context it also significant to point out that this is meccan verse quran if the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is disease and the alarmists in the city do not cease we verily shall urge thee on against them then they will be your neighbors in it but little while accursed they will be seized wherever found and slain with fierce slaughter this passage sanctions the slaughter rendered merciless and horrible murder in other translations against three groups hypocrites muslims who refuse to fight in the way of allah and hence don act as muslims should those with diseased hearts which include jews and christians and alarmists or agitators who include those who merely speak out against islam according to muhammad biographers it is worth noting that the victims are to be sought out by muslims which is what today terrorists do if this passage is meant merely to apply to the city of medina then it is unclear why it is included in allah eternal word to muslim generations quran those who disbelieve follow falsehood while those who believe follow the truth from their lord so when you meet in fight jihad in allah cause those who disbelieve smite at their necks till when you have killed and wounded many of them then bind bond firmly on them take them as captives if it had been allah will he himself could certainly have punished them without you but he lets you fight in order to test you some with others but those who are killed in the way of allah he will never let their deeds be lost those who reject allah are to be killed in jihad the wounded are to be held captive for ransom the only reason allah doesn do the dirty work himself is to to test the faithfulness of muslims those who kill pass the test quran be not weary and faint-hearted crying for peace when ye should be uppermost shakir have the upper hand for allah is with you quran there is no blame for the blind nor is there blame for the lame nor is there blame for the sick that they go not forth to war and whoso obeyeth allah and his messenger he will make him enter gardens underneath which rivers flow and whoso turneth back him will he punish with painful doom contemporary apologists sometimes claim that jihad means spiritual struggle is so then why are the blind lame and sick exempted this verse also says that those who do not fight will suffer torment in hell quran muhammad is the messenger of allah and those with him are hard ruthless against the disbelievers and merciful among themselves islam is not about treating everyone equally there are two very distinct standards that are applied based on religious status also the word used for hard or ruthless in this verse shares the same root as the word translated as painful or severe in verse quran surely allah loves those who fight in his way religion of peace indeed the verse explicitly refers to battle array meaning that it is speaking of physical conflict this is followed by he it is who has sent his messenger mohammed with guidance and the religion of truth islam to make it victorious over all religions even though the infidels may resist see next verse below infidels who resist islamic rule are to be fought quran you who believe shall guide you to commerce that will save you from painful torment that you believe in allah and his messenger muhammad and that you strive hard and fight in the cause of allah with your wealth and your lives that will be better for you if you but know if you do so he will forgive you your sins and admit you into gardens under which rivers flow and pleasant dwelling in gardens of adn eternity adn edn paradise that is indeed the great success this verse refers to physical battle in order to make islam victorious over other religions see above it uses the arabic word jihad quran prophet strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites and be stern with them hell will be their home hapless journey end the root word of jihad is used again here the context is clearly holy war and the scope of violence is broadened to include hypocrites those who call themselves muslims but do not act as such other verses calling muslims to jihad can be found here at from the hadith bukhari allah apostle said the hour will not be established until you fight with the jews and the stone behind which jew will be hiding will say muslim there is jew hiding behind me so kill him bukhari the prophet was asked whether it was permissible to attack the pagan warriors at night with the probability of exposing their women and children to danger the prophet replied they women and children are from them pagans in this command muhammad establishes that it is permissible to kill non-combatants in the process of killing perceived enemy this provides justification for the many islamic terror bombings bukhari the prophet said he who fights that allah word islam should be superior fights in allah cause muhammad words are the basis for offensive jihad spreading islam by force this is how it was understood by his companions and by the terrorists of today bukhari allah apostle said have been made victorious with terror	0
it pretty simple islam means terror the quran quran and kill them wherever you find them and turn them out from where they have turned you out and al-fitnah disbelief or unrest is worse than killing but if they desist then lo allah is forgiving and merciful and fight them until there is no more fitnah disbelief and worshipping of others along with allah and worship is for allah alone but if they cease let there be no transgression except against az-zalimun the polytheists and wrong-doers etc translation is from the noble quran the historical context of this passage is not defensive warfare since muhammad and his muslims had just relocated to medina and were not under attack by their meccan adversaries in fact the verses urge offensive warfare in that muslims are to drive meccans out of their own city which they later did the use of the word persecution by some muslim translators is thus disingenuous the actual muslim words for persecution idtihad and oppression variation of z-l-m do not appear in the verse the actual arabic comes from fitna which can mean disbelief or the disorder that results from unbelief or temptation taken as whole the context makes clear that violence is being authorized until religion is for allah ie unbelievers desist in their unbelief quran then fight in the cause of allah and know that allah heareth and knoweth all things quran fighting is prescribed for you and ye dislike it but it is possible that ye dislike thing which is good for you and that ye love thing which is bad for you but allah knoweth and ye know not not only does this verse establish that violence can be virtuous but it also contradicts the myth that fighting is intended only in self-defense since the audience was obviously not under attack at the time from the hadith we know that this verse was narrated at time that muhammad was actually trying to motivate his people into raiding merchant caravans for loot quran as to those who reject faith will punish them with terrible agony in this world and in the hereafter nor will they have anyone to help quran soon shall we cast terror into the hearts of the unbelievers for that they joined companions with allah for which he had sent no authority this speaks directly of polytheists yet it also includes christians since they believe in the trinity ie what muhammad incorrectly believed to be joining companions to allah quran let those fight in the way of allah who sell the life of this world for the other whoso fighteth in the way of allah be he slain or be he victorious on him we shall bestow vast reward the martyrs of islam are unlike the early christians who were led meekly to the slaughter these muslims are killed in battle as they attempt to inflict death and destruction for the cause of allah this is the theological basis for today suicide bombers quran those who believe fight in the cause of allah quran they but wish that ye should reject faith as they do and thus be on the same footing as they but take not friends from their ranks until they flee in the way of allah from what is forbidden but if they turn renegades seize them and slay them wherever ye find them and in any case take no friends or helpers from their ranks quran not equal are those believers who sit at home and receive no hurt and those who strive and fight in the cause of allah with their goods and their persons allah hath granted grade higher to those who strive and fight with their goods and persons than to those who sit at home unto all in faith hath allah promised good but those who strive and fight hath he distinguished above those who sit at home by special reward this passage criticizes peaceful muslims who do not join in the violence letting them know that they are less worthy in allah eyes it also demolishes the modern myth that jihad doesn mean holy war in the quran but rather spiritual struggle not only is the arabic word used in this passage but it is clearly notreferring to anything spiritual since the physically disabled are given exemption the hadith reveals the context of the passage to be in response to blind man protest that he is unable to engage in jihad and this is reflected in other translations of the verse quran and be not weak hearted in pursuit of the enemy if you suffer pain then surely they too suffer pain as you suffer pain is pursuing an injured and retreating enemy really an act of self-defense quran the punishment of those who wage war against allah and his messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is only this that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned this shall be as disgrace for them in this world and in the hereafter they shall have grievous chastisement quran will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them no reasonable person would interpret this to mean spiritual struggle quran ye who believe when ye meet those who disbelieve in battle turn not your backs to them whoso on that day turneth his back to them unless maneuvering for battle or intent to join company he truly hath incurred wrath from allah and his habitation will be hell hapless journey end quran and fight with them until there is no more fitna disorder unbelief and religion should be only for allah some translations interpret fitna as persecution but the traditional understanding of this word is not supported by the historical context see notes for the meccans were simply refusing muhammad access to their city during haj other muslims were allowed to travel there just not as an armed group since muhammad had declared war on mecca prior to his eviction the meccans were also acting in defense of their religion since it was muhammad intention to destroy their idols and establish islam by force which he later did hence the critical part of this verse is to fight until religion is only for allah meaning that the true justification of violence was the unbelief of the opposition according to the sira ibn ishaq hisham muhammad further explains that allah must have no rivals quran if thou comest on them in the war deal with them so as to strike fear in those who are behind them that haply they may remember quran it is not for prophet that he should have prisoners of war until he had made great slaughter in the land quran and let not those who disbelieve suppose that they can outstrip allah purpose lo they cannot escape make ready for them all thou canst of armed force and of horses tethered that thereby ye may dismay the enemy of allah and your enemy quran prophet exhort the believers to fight quran so when the sacred months have passed away then slay the idolaters wherever you find them and take them captive and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush then if they repent and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate leave their way free to them according to this verse the best way of staying safe from muslim violence is to convert to islam prayer salat and the poor tax zakat are among the religion five pillars this popular claim that the quran only inspires violence within the context of self-defense is seriously challenged by this passage as well since the muslims to whom it was written were obviously not under attack had they been then there would have been no waiting period earlier verses make it duty for muslims to fight in self-defense even during the sacred months the historical context is mecca after the idolaters were subjugated by muhammad and posed no threat once the muslims had power they violently evicted those unbelievers who would not convert quran fight against them so that allah will punish them by your hands and disgrace them and give you victory over them and heal the breasts of believing people humiliating and hurting non-believers not only has the blessing of allah but it is ordered as means of carrying out his punishment and even healing the hearts of muslims quran those who believe and have left their homes and striven with their wealth and their lives in allah way are of much greater worth in allah sight these are they who are triumphant the arabic word interpreted as striving in this verse is the same root as jihad the context is obviously holy war quran fight those who believe not in allah nor the last day nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by allah and his messenger nor acknowledge the religion of truth even if they are of the people of the book until they pay the jizya with willing submission and feel themselves subdued people of the book refers to christians and jews according to this verse they are to be violently subjugated with the sole justification being their religious status this was one of the final revelations from allah and it set in motion the tenacious military expansion in which muhammad companions managed to conquer two-thirds of the christian world in the next years islam is intended to dominate all other people and faiths quran and the jews say ezra is the son of allah and the christians say the messiah is the son of allah these are the words of their mouths they imitate the saying of those who disbelieved before may allah destroy them how they are turned away quran ye who believe what is the matter with you that when ye are asked to go forth in the cause of allah ye cling heavily to the earth do ye prefer the life of this world to the hereafter but little is the comfort of this life as compared with the hereafter unless ye go forth he will punish you with grievous penalty and put others in your place this is warning to those who refuse to fight that they will be punished with hell quran go forth light-armed and heavy-armed and strive with your wealth and your lives in the way of allah that is best for you if ye but knew see also the verse that follows if there had been immediate gain in sight and the journey easy they would all without doubt have followed thee but the distance was long and weighed on them this contradicts the myth that muslims are to fight only in self-defense since the wording implies that battle will be waged long distance from home in another country and on christian soil in this case according to the historians quran prophet strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be unyielding to them and their abode is hell and evil is the destination dehumanizing those who reject islam by reminding muslims that unbelievers are merely firewood for hell makes it easier to justify slaughter it also explains why today devout muslims have little regard for those outside the faith quran but the messenger and those who believe with him strive and fight with their wealth and their persons for them are all good things and it is they who will prosper quran allah hath purchased of the believers their persons and their goods for theirs in return is the garden of paradise they fight in his cause and slay and are slain promise binding on him in truth through the law the gospel and the quran and who is more faithful to his covenant than allah then rejoice in the bargain which ye have concluded that is the achievement supreme how does the quran define true believer quran you who believe fight those of the unbelievers who are near to you and let them find in you hardness quran and when we wish to destroy town we send our commandment to the people of it who lead easy lives but they transgress therein thus the word proves true against it so we destroy it with utter destruction note that the crime is moral transgression and the punishment is utter destruction before ordering the attacks osama bin laden first issued americans an invitation to islam quran this parable lays the theological groundwork for honor killings in which family member is murdered because they brought shame to the family either through apostasy or perceived moral indiscretion the story which is not found in any jewish or christian source tells of moses encountering man with special knowledge who does things which don seem to make sense on the surface but are then justified according to later explanation one such action is to murder youth for no apparent reason however the wise man later explains that it was feared that the boy would grieve his parents by disobedience and ingratitude he was killed so that allah could provide them better son note this is one reason why honor killing is sanctioned by sharia reliance of the traveler umdat al-saliq says that punishment for murder is not applicable when parent or grandparent kills their offspring quran we gave the good things of this life to these men and their fathers until the period grew long for them see they not that we gradually reduce the land in their control from its outlying borders is it then they who will win quran therefore listen not to the unbelievers but strive against them with

ronald reagan was the greatest president of my lifetime that is not being disputed said there were good things ronald reagan did but to ignore the negatives is to turn ronald reagan in to something he was not apparently to you ronald reagan is deity these are facts that have been vetted and proven through scrutiny research reagan was serial tax raiser as governor of california reagan signed into law the largest tax increase in the history of any state up till then meanwhile state spending nearly doubled as president reagan raised taxes in seven of his eight years in office including four times in just two years as former gop senator alan simpson who called reagan dear friend told npr ronald reagan raised taxes times in his administration was there reagan was never afraid to raise taxes said historian douglas brinkley who edited reagan memoir reagan the anti-tax zealot is false mythology brinkley said reagan nearly tripled the federal budget deficit during the reagan years the debt increased to nearly trillion roughly three times as much as the first years of the century had done altogether reagan enacted major tax cut his first year in office and government revenue dropped off precipitously despite the conservative myth that tax cuts somehow increase revenue the government went deeper into debt and reagan had to raise taxes just year after he enacted his tax cut despite ten more tax hikes on everything from gasoline to corporate income reagan was never able to get the deficit under control unemployment soared after reagan tax cuts unemployment jumped to percent after reagan enacted his much-touted tax cut and it took years for the rate to get back down to its previous level meanwhile income inequality exploded despite the myth that reagan presided over an era of unmatched economic boom for all americans reagan disproportionately taxed the poor and middle class but the economic growth of the did little help them since median household income has risen only percent adjusted for inflation while average incomes at the top have tripled or quadrupled the new york times david leonhardt noted reagan grew the size of the federal government tremendously reagan promised to move boldly decisively and quickly to control the runaway growth of federal spending but federal spending ballooned under reagan he bailed out social security in after attempting to privatize it and set up progressive taxation system to keep it funded into the future he promised to cut government agencies like the department of energy and education but ended up adding one of the largest the department of veterans affairs which today has budget of nearly billion and close to employees he also hiked defense spending by over billion year to level not seen since the height of the vietnam war reagan did little to fight woman right to choose as governor of california in reagan signed bill to liberalize the state abortion laws that resulted in more than million abortions when reagan ran for president he advocated constitutional amendment that would have prohibited all abortions except when necessary to save the life of the mother but once in office he never seriously pursued curbing choice reagan was bellicose peacenik he wrote in his memoirs that dream became world free of nuclear weapons this vision stemmed from the president belief that the biblical account of armageddon prophesied nuclear war and that apocalypse could be averted if everyone especially the soviets eliminated nuclear weapons the washington monthly noted and reagan military buildup was meant to crush the soviet union but also to put the united states in stronger position from which to establish effective arms control for the the entire world vision acted out by regean vice president george bush when he became president reagan gave amnesty to million undocumented immigrants reagan signed into law bill that made any immigrant who had entered the country before eligible for amnesty the bill was sold as crackdown but its tough sanctions on employers who hired undocumented immigrants were removed before final passage the bill helped million people and millions more family members gain american residency it has since become source of major embarrassment for conservatives reagan illegally funneled weapons to iran reagan and other senior officials secretly sold arms to officials in iran which was subject to an arms embargo at the time in exchange for american hostages some funds from the illegal arms sales also went to fund anti-communist rebels in nicaragua something congress had already prohibited the administration from doing when the deals went public the iran-contra affair as it came to be know was an enormous political scandal that forced several senior administration officials to resign reagan vetoed comprehensive anti-apartheid act which placed sanctions on south africa and cut off all american trade with the country reagan veto was overridden by the republican-controlled senate reagan responded by saying deeply regret that congress has seen fit to override my veto saying that the law will not solve the serious problems that plague that country reagan helped create the taliban and osama bin laden reagan fought proxy war with the soviet union by training arming equipping and funding islamist mujahidin fighters in afghanistan reagan funneled billions of dollars along with top-secret intelligence and sophisticated weaponry to these fighters through the pakistani intelligence service the talbian and osama bin laden prominent mujahidin commander emerged from these mujahidin groups reagan helped create and policy towards pakistan remains strained because of the intelligence services close relations to these fighters in fact reagan decision to continue the proxy war after the soviets were willing to retreat played direct role in bin laden ascendancy	0

is grateful for the support of american of america people and of america presidents from harry truman to barack obama applause we appreciate all that president obama has done for israel now some of that is widely known applause some of that is widely known like strengthening security cooperation and intelligence sharing opposing anti-israel resolutions at the some of what the president has done for israel is less well- known called him in when we had the carmel forest fire and he immediately agreed to respond to my request for urgent aid in we had our embassy in cairo under siege and again he provided vital assistance at the crucial moment or his support for more missile interceptors during our operation last summer when we took on hamas terrorists applause in each of those moments called the president and he was there and some of what the president has done for israel might never be known because it touches on some of the most sensitive and strategic issues that arise between an american president and an israeli prime minister but know it and will always be grateful to president obama for that support applause and israel is grateful to you the american congress for your support for supporting us in so many ways especially in generous military assistance and missile defense including iron dome applause last summer millions of israelis were protected from thousands of hamas rockets because this capital dome helped build our iron dome applause thank you america thank you for everything you ve done for israel my friends ve come here today because as prime minister of israel feel profound obligation to speak to you about an issue that could well threaten the survival of my country and the future of my people iran quest for nuclear weapons we re an ancient people in our nearly years of history many have tried repeatedly to destroy the jewish people tomorrow night on the jewish holiday of purim we ll read the book of esther we ll read of powerful persian viceroy named haman who plotted to destroy the jewish people some years ago but courageous jewish woman queen esther exposed the plot and gave for the jewish people the right to defend themselves against their enemies the plot was foiled our people were saved applause today the jewish people face another attempt by yet another persian potentate to destroy us iran supreme leader ayatollah khamenei spews the oldest hatred the oldest hatred of anti-semitism with the newest technology he tweets that israel must be annihilated he tweets you know in iran there isn exactly free internet but he tweets in english that israel must be destroyed for those who believe that iran threatens the jewish state but not the jewish people listen to hassan nasrallah the leader of hezbollah iran chief terrorist proxy he said if all the jews gather in israel it will save us the trouble of chasing them down around the world but iran regime is not merely jewish problem any more than the nazi regime was merely jewish problem the million jews murdered by the nazis were but fraction of the million people killed in world war ii so too iran regime poses grave threat not only to israel but also the peace of the entire world to understand just how dangerous iran would be with nuclear weapons we must fully understand the nature of the regime the people of iran are very talented people they re heirs to one of the world great civilizations but in they were hijacked by religious zealots religious zealots who imposed on them immediately dark and brutal dictatorship that year the zealots drafted constitution new one for iran it directed the revolutionary guards not only to protect iran borders but also to fulfill the ideological mission of jihad the regime founder ayatollah khomeini exhorted his followers to export the revolution throughout the world standing here in washington and the difference is so stark america founding document promises life liberty and the pursuit of happiness iran founding document pledges death tyranny and the pursuit of jihad and as states are collapsing across the middle east iran is charging into the void to do just that iran goons in gaza its lackeys in lebanon its revolutionary guards on the golan heights are clutching israel with three tentacles of terror backed by iran assad is slaughtering syrians back by iran shiite militias are rampaging through iraq back by iran houthis are seizing control of yemen threatening the strategic straits at the mouth of the red sea along with the straits of hormuz that would give iran second choke-point on the world oil supply just last week near hormuz iran carried out military exercise blowing up mock aircraft carrier that just last week while they re having nuclear talks with the united states but unfortunately for the last years iran attacks against the united states have been anything but mock and the targets have been all too real iran took dozens of americans hostage in tehran murdered hundreds of american soldiers marines in beirut and was responsible for killing and maiming thousands of american service men and women in iraq and afghanistan beyond the middle east iran attacks america and its allies through its global terror network it blew up the jewish community center and the israeli embassy in buenos aires it helped al qaida bomb embassies in africa it even attempted to assassinate the saudi ambassador right here in washington in the middle east iran now dominates four arab capitals baghdad damascus beirut and sanaa and if iran aggression is left unchecked more will surely follow so at time when many hope that iran will join the community of nations iran is busy gobbling up the nations applause we must all stand together to stop iran march of conquest subjugation and terror applause now two years ago we were told to give president rouhani and foreign minister zarif chance to bring change and moderation to iran some change some moderation rouhani government hangs gays persecutes christians jails journalists and executes even more prisoners than before last year the same zarif who charms western diplomats laid wreath at the grave of imad mughniyeh imad mughniyeh is the terrorist mastermind who spilled more american blood than any other terrorist besides osama bin laden like to see someone ask him question about that iran regime is as radical as ever its cries of death to america that same america that it calls the great satan as loud as ever now this shouldn be surprising because the ideology of iran revolutionary regime is deeply rooted in militant islam and that why this regime will always be an enemy of america don be fooled the battle between iran and isis doesn turn iran into friend of america iran and isis are competing for the crown of militant islam one calls itself the islamic republic the other calls itself the islamic state both want to impose militant islamic empire first on the region and then on the entire world they just disagree among themselves who will be the ruler of that empire in this deadly game of thrones there no place for america or for israel no peace for christians jews or muslims who don share the islamist medieval creed no rights for women no freedom for anyone so when it comes to iran and isis the enemy of your enemy is your enemy applause the difference is that isis is armed with butcher knives captured weapons and youtube whereas iran could soon be armed with intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear bombs we must always remember ll say it one more time the greatest dangers facing our world is the marriage of militant islam with nuclear weapons to defeat isis and let iran get nuclear weapons would be to win the battle but lose the war we can let that happen applause but that my friends is exactly what could happen if the deal now being negotiated is accepted by iran that deal will not prevent iran from developing nuclear weapons it would all but guarantee that iran gets those weapons lots of them let me explain why while the final deal has not yet been signed certain elements of any potential deal are now matter of public record you don need intelligence agencies and secret information to know this you can google it absent dramatic change we know for sure that any deal with iran will include two major concessions to iran the first major concession would leave iran with vast nuclear infrastructure providing it with short break-out time to the bomb break-out time is the time it takes to amass enough weapons-grade uranium or plutonium for nuclear bomb according to the deal not single nuclear facility would be demolished thousands of centrifuges used to enrich uranium would be left spinning thousands more would be temporarily disconnected but not destroyed because iran nuclear program would be left largely intact iran break-out time would be very short about year by assessment even shorter by israel and if if iran work on advanced centrifuges faster and faster centrifuges is not stopped that break-out time could still be shorter lot shorter true certain restrictions would be imposed on iran nuclear program and iran adherence to those restrictions would be supervised by international inspectors but here the problem you see inspectors document violations they don stop them inspectors knew when north korea broke to the bomb but that didn stop anything north korea turned off the cameras kicked out the inspectors within few years it got the bomb now we re warned that within five years north korea could have an arsenal of nuclear bombs like north korea iran too has defied international inspectors it done that on at least three separate occasions like north korea iran broke the locks shut off the cameras now know this is not gonna come shock as shock to any of you but iran not only defies inspectors it also plays pretty good game of hide-and-cheat with them the nuclear watchdog agency the iaea said again yesterday that iran still refuses to come clean about its military nuclear program iran was also caught caught twice not once twice operating secret nuclear facilities in natanz and qom facilities that inspectors didn even know existed right now iran could be hiding nuclear facilities that we don know about the and israel as the former head of inspections for the iaea said in he said if there no undeclared installation today in iran it will be the first time in years that it doesn have one iran has proven time and again that it cannot be trusted and that why the first major concession is source of great concern it leaves iran with vast nuclear infrastructure and relies on inspectors to prevent breakout that concession creates real danger that iran could get to the bomb by violating the deal but the second major concession creates an even greater danger that iran could get to the bomb by keeping the deal because virtually all the restrictions on iran nuclear program will automatically expire in about decade now decade may seem like long time in political life but it the blink of an eye in the life of nation it blink of an eye in the life of our children we all have responsibility to consider what will happen when iran nuclear capabilities are virtually unrestricted and all the sanctions will have been lifted iran would then be free to build huge nuclear capacity that could product many many nuclear bombs iran supreme leader says that openly he says iran plans to have centrifuges not or even the that iran has today but times that amount centrifuges enriching uranium with this massive capacity iran could make the fuel for an entire nuclear arsenal and this in matter of weeks once it makes that decision my long-time friend john kerry secretary of state confirmed last week that iran could legitimately possess that massive centrifuge capacity when the deal expires now want you to think about that the foremost sponsor of global terrorism could be weeks away from having enough enriched uranium for an entire arsenal of nuclear weapons and this with full international legitimacy and by the way if iran intercontinental ballistic missile program is not part of the deal and so far iran refuses to even put it on the negotiating table well iran could have the means to deliver that nuclear arsenal to the far-reach corners of the earth including to every part of the united states so you see my friends this deal has two major concessions one leaving iran with vast nuclear program and two lifting the restrictions on that program in about decade that why this deal is so bad it doesn block iran path to the bomb it paves iran path to the bomb so why would anyone make this deal because they hope that iran will change for the better in the coming years or they believe that the alternative to this deal is worse well disagree don believe that iran radical regime will change for the better after this deal this regime has been in power for years and its voracious appetite for aggression grows with each passing year this deal would wet appetite would only wet iran appetite for more would iran be less aggressive when sanctions are removed and its economy is stronger if iran is gobbling up four countries right now while it under sanctions how many more countries will iran devour when sanctions are lifted would iran fund less terrorism when it has mountains of cash with which to fund more terrorism why should iran radical regime change for the better when it can enjoy the best of both world aggression abroad prosperity at home this is question that everyone asks in our region israel neighbors iran neighbors know that iran will become even more aggressive and sponsor even more terrorism when its economy is unshackled and it been given clear path to the bomb and many of these neighbors say they ll respond by racing to get nuclear weapons of their own so this deal won change iran for the better it will only change the middle east for the worse deal that supposed to prevent nuclear proliferation would instead spark nuclear arms race in the most dangerous part of the planet this deal won be farewell to arms it would be farewell to arms control and the middle east would soon be crisscrossed by nuclear tripwires region where small skirmishes can trigger big wars would turn into nuclear tinderbox if anyone thinks if anyone thinks this deal kicks the can down the road think again when we get down that road we ll face much more dangerous iran middle east littered with nuclear bombs and countdown to potential nuclear nightmare ladies and gentlemen ve come here today to tell you we don have to bet the security of the world on the hope that iran will change for the better we don have to gamble with our future and with our children future we can insist that restrictions on iran nuclear program not be lifted for as long as iran continues its aggression in the region and in the world applause before lifting those restrictions the world should demand that iran do three things first stop its aggression against its neighbors in the middle east second applause second stop supporting terrorism around the world applause and third stop threatening to annihilate my country israel the one and only jewish state applause thank you if the world powers are not prepared to insist that iran change its behavior before deal is signed at the very least they should insist that iran change its behavior before deal expires applause if iran changes its behavior the restrictions would be lifted if iran doesn change its behavior the restrictions should not be lifted applause if iran wants to be treated like normal country let it act like normal country applause my friends what about the argument that there no alternative to this deal that iran nuclear know-how cannot be erased that its nuclear program is so advanced that the best we can do is delay the inevitable which is essentially what the proposed deal seeks to do well nuclear know-how without nuclear infrastructure doesn get you very much racecar driver without car can drive pilot without plan can fly without thousands of centrifuges tons of enriched uranium or heavy water facilities iran can make nuclear weapons applause iran nuclear program can be rolled back well-beyond the current proposal by insisting on better deal and keeping up the pressure on very vulnerable regime especially given the recent collapse in the price of oil applause now if iran threatens to walk away from the table and this often happens in persian bazaar call their bluff they ll be back because they need the deal lot more than you do applause and by maintaining the pressure on iran and on those who do business with iran you have the power to make them need it even more my friends for over year we ve been told that no deal is better than bad deal well this is bad deal it very bad deal we re better off without it applause now we re being told that the only alternative to this bad deal is war that just not true the alternative to this bad deal is much better deal applause better deal that doesn leave iran with vast nuclear infrastructure and such short break-out time better deal that keeps the restrictions on iran nuclear program in place until iran aggression ends applause better deal that won give iran an easy path to the bomb better deal that israel and its neighbors may not like but with which we could live literally and no country applause no country has greater stake no country has greater stake than israel in good deal that peacefully removes this threat ladies and gentlemen history has placed us at fateful crossroads we must now choose between two paths one path leads to bad deal that will at best curtail iran nuclear ambitions for while but it will inexorably lead to nuclear-armed iran whose unbridled aggression will inevitably lead to war the second path however difficult could lead to much better deal that would prevent nuclear-armed iran nuclearized middle east and the horrific consequences of both to all of humanity you don have to read robert frost to know you have to live life to know that the difficult path is usually the one less traveled but it will make all the difference for the future of my country the security of the middle east and the peace of the world the peace we all desire applause my friend standing up to iran is not easy standing up to dark and murderous regimes never is with us today is holocaust survivor and nobel prize winner elie wiesel applause elie your life and work inspires to give meaning to the words never again applause and wish could promise you elie that the lessons of history have been learned can only urge the leaders of the world not to repeat the mistakes of the past applause not to sacrifice the future for the present not to ignore aggression in the hopes of gaining an illusory peace but can guarantee you this the days when the jewish people remained passive in the face of genocidal enemies those days are over applause we are no longer scattered among the nations powerless to defend ourselves we restored our sovereignty in our ancient home and the soldiers who defend our home have boundless courage for the first time in generations we the jewish people can defend ourselves applause this is why this is why as prime minister of israel can promise you one more thing even if israel has to stand alone israel will stand applause but know that israel does not stand alone know that america stands with israel applause know that you stand with israel applause you stand with israel because you know that the story of israel is not only the story of the jewish people but of the human spirit that refuses again and again to succumb to history horrors applause facing me right up there in the gallery overlooking all of us in this inaudible chamber is the image of moses moses led our people from slavery to the gates of the promised land and before the people of israel entered the land of israel moses gave us message that has steeled our resolve for thousands of years leave you with his message today speaking in hebrew be strong and resolute neither fear nor dread them my friends may israel and america always stand together strong and resolute may we neither fear nor dread the challenges ahead may we face the future with confidence strength and hope may god bless the state of israel and may god bless the united states of america applause thank you thank you very much thank you all you re wonderful thank you america thank you thank you	0

essentially what the proposed deal seeks to do well nuclear know-how without nuclear infrastructure doesn get you very much racecar driver without car can drive pilot without plan can fly without thousands of centrifuges tons of enriched uranium or heavy water facilities iran can make nuclear weapons iran nuclear program can be rolled back well-beyond the current proposal by insisting on better deal and keeping up the pressure on very vulnerable regime especially given the recent collapse in the price of oil now if iran threatens to walk away from the table and this often happens in persian bazaar call their bluff they ll be back because they need the deal lot more than you do and by maintaining the pressure on iran and on those who do business with iran you have the power to make them need it even more my friends for over year we ve been told that no deal is better than bad deal well this is bad deal it very bad deal we re better off without it now we re being told that the only alternative to this bad deal is war that just not true the alternative to this bad deal is much better deal better deal that doesn leave iran with vast nuclear infrastructure and such short break-out time better deal that keeps the restrictions on iran nuclear program in place until iran aggression ends better deal that won give iran an easy path to the bomb better deal that israel and its neighbors may not like but with which we could live literally and no country no country has greater stake no country has greater stake than israel in good deal that peacefully removes this threat ladies and gentlemen history has placed us at fateful crossroads we must now choose between two paths one path leads to bad deal that will at best curtail iran nuclear ambitions for while but it will inexorably lead to nuclear-armed iran whose unbridled aggression will inevitably lead to war the second path however difficult could lead to much better deal that would prevent nuclear-armed iran nuclearized middle east and the horrific consequences of both to all of humanity you don have to read robert frost to know you have to live life to know that the difficult path is usually the one less traveled but it will make all the difference for the future of my country the security of the middle east and the peace of the world the peace we all desire my friend standing up to iran is not easy standing up to dark and murderous regimes never is with us today is holocaust survivor and nobel prize winner elie wiesel elie your life and work inspires to give meaning to the words never again and wish could promise you elie that the lessons of history have been learned can only urge the leaders of the world not to repeat the mistakes of the past not to sacrifice the future for the present not to ignore aggression in the hopes of gaining an illusory peace but can guarantee you this the days when the jewish people remained passive in the face of genocidal enemies those days are over we are no longer scattered among the nations powerless to defend ourselves we restored our sovereignty in our ancient home and the soldiers who defend our home have boundless courage for the first time in generations we the jewish people can defend ourselves this is why this is why as prime minister of israel can promise you one more thing even if israel has to stand alone israel will stand but know that israel does not stand alone know that america stands with israel know that you stand with israel you stand with israel because you know that the story of israel is not only the story of the jewish people but of the human spirit that refuses again and again to succumb to history horrors facing me right up there in the gallery overlooking all of us in this inaudible chamber is the image of moses moses led our people from slavery to the gates of the promised land and before the people of israel entered the land of israel moses gave us message that has steeled our resolve for thousands of years leave you with his message today speaking in hebrew be strong and resolute neither fear nor dread them my friends may israel and america always stand together strong and resolute may we neither fear nor dread the challenges ahead may we face the future with confidence strength and hope may god bless the state of israel and may god bless the united states of america thank you thank you very much thank you all you re wonderful thank you america thank you thank you	0

not sure what conservative means anymore is that levin candidate beck or limbaugh these guys always compare their candidate to reagan as for comparing reagan to trump one could argue trump policies are similar to or more hard line than reagan some would think reagan choices tenure sound just like today democrat he nearly tripled the national debt trump wants to reduce debt as governor of california he signed the largest tax increase in history at that time and raised taxes in seven of his eight years as president trump wants to cut taxes reagan did cut taxes later he bailed out social security in after attempting to privatize it trump supports ss he helped create the taliban freedom fighters in afghanistan which saw the rise of osama bin laden trump foresaw bin laden as threat as governor of california he signed liberal abortion law was anti-abortion as president but didn push pro-life agenda trump moderate on abortion imo he granted amnesty for three million illegal immigrants trump against he did not go to war in iraq when the choice was put in front of him trump similar re iraq he built up the military peace through strength trump same evidence reagan was tolerant of gays was against banning gay teachers trump not anti-gay he was for school prayer trump supports christianity he took the threat of cfcs and the damage they caused to our ozone layer seriously and took action to reduce emissions trump anti climate change he said do believe that an ak- machine gun is not sporting weapon or needed for defense of home trump pro- nd amend he was democrat before turning republican trump same trump policies sure look lot like reagan maybe even harder-line trump very similar to reagan in terms of charisma besides trump is obviously great father based on how his kids turned out and he built empire to boot loved reagan but enough with other candidates claiming reagan principles when they are massively far right of reagan to get elected or if elected their far-right agenda will never become law trump	0

after the attacks of spy agencies conflated monitoring violent maniacs to dragnet of monitoring ordinary americans this was purposely done to expand the national security state where the individual matters little and the purpose of government is to expand corporate profits and conduct war br br osama bin laden and his followers needed to be pursued until captured but expanding wars to several countries has done nothing to enhance security in the or maintain the tradition of individual rights in the that government surveillance threatens	0

why are facts anathema to lefties because they have goals and sometimes facts get in the way the same can be said of republicans please try not to confuse republicans and conservatives the lying a$$ holes in the republican party do not represent middle class conservatives affirmative action is destructive to all ametican standards of excellence immigration destroys the ability of all americans of making living wage and it is counter to the environmentalist principles of zero population growth yet the left keeps pushing for these issues it is an anathema to logic and reason but it doesn suite their goal of taking down america and reducing whites to minority try to respond to me without calling me names or psychoanalysis of my motivations will see what happens	0
commenters are pointing out that trump reflects tragic flaw in ametican society and its culture br would tend to agree but this time the influence of another actor on the world stage takes precedence br vladimir putin and his minions have trump by his little hands and won let go br as for taking the oil pathetic thinking on every possible level unneeded unwanted and immoral	0

we should all really focus on what is about to come paul ryan and his plan for america doesn include the just the rich ass trump truly is gift for the reuplican congress and senate going on yrs of gerry mandrian district and whole lot of state legeslators this isn going to be easy so let stop all this crap just talking at each other and start talking to each other let focus on really talking back our democracy for the people and by the people	0
sure republican leadership but reuplican voters which is what actually matters would be probably be more open to hillary if they even had shred of faith that she actually do anything in their interests	0
reuplican voters and republican party you might want to start standing up for your democracy because trump is literally destroying it	0
if recall donald trump was ok with gay equality before it was popular he was ok with gay equality when the clintons barrak obama and most of the mainstream democrats were saying no or being ambivalent towards the issue mike pence not withstanding his bigoted opionion only counts if donald dies or the senate ties donald has trumped the left pun definitely intended on an important demographic you assumed was yours to the point of taking it for granted and now that gay married people who now might be looking at taxes and healthcare and have legitimate choice it scares the hell out of the left and their boogeyman way of getting votes you must now destroy donald destroy his powerbase and show those worthless white trash hicks who is in charge all to keep the power in the hand of select group of elites with or an by their name we gave the reuplican establishment the big middle finger suggest you democrats do the same to your establishment	0
the reuplican solution to an imperfect political system and show of love for america	0
and once again romney wasn mocked for hiring more women him and his party were criticized for the fact that without making special effort they couldn find qualified women there are just as many qualifed women as men it shouldn take romney telling his staffers to hunt them down to find them it hardly moronic to say someone saying that his staff couldn find qualified female candidates without special directive from him might not have the most modern workplace in the first place republicans have consistently been the more prejudiced party against women more not only that means yeah they re probably going to to have to show more effort that they re not that life that tough and then going and voting for grab em by the pussy and saying it democrats fault not only shows that the reuplican party continues to be the party against equality but that they re entitled spoiled brats who cannot accept the consequences of their actions no one forced trump voters to vote for trump no one forced the republican party to accept him no one is forcing republicans to continue to support him and once again it one comment made in an entire presidential race that was viewed unfavorably if someone defines their views soley based on the opposition thats thats pathetic	0
reuplican party and friends are just speed bump on the road of human evolution so please evolve just little bit and go ahead and move to russia	0
think think big difference is that all the democratic primaries split delegates while many of the reuplican primaries are winner take all	0
just how long before reuplican voters actually figure out just how ignorant trump really is guess when million people loose their health care maybe it will begin to show voters that tump and the republican party fox news are full of shit fox news now the number one news organization in the country fair and balanced what fn joke	0
as brash and vulgar as trump is his presidency has not yet led to mass immiseration or significant loss of life let start the worst of list with the likes of say calvin coolidge coolidge reuplican in the classical liberal tradition was responsible in some part for the mass unemployment and impoverishment of his own people refusing to intervene in the economy to ameliorate the great depression	0
kind of like when bill maher doesn have reuplican on the panel	0
psst with the exception of bill efforts to reduce the national debt with dot com windfall money clintonomics reaganomics	1
bill will be in charge of clintonomics wonder if he will wear hamburgler mask or just walk straight in the front door and start filling up sack with the word swag written on the side	1
typical clintonomics above the laws that supposidly are written for all	1
you think bush economic policy was anything close to clintonomics it wasn	1
they re not saying they re the same dingus they re pointing out that reaganomics and clintonomics drive inequality which will inevitably lead to political crisis like trump and the current corrupt gop the neoliberal status quo is not to blame for trump but it does share responsibility and people like you who refuse to admit this obvious fact are not helping us fix it	1
the democratic party needs grass roots reform hillary and wasserman-schultz are about the last people you want for that they both are autocratic top-down elitists that believe they know what best for everyone and who have led the democratic party away from state strategy that bernie was so able to tap into just by being honest and telling the truth we need more bernie-like people half his age to go forth and take the democratic party back from the clintonomics people we need concerted effort to take back the house and senate in something wasserman-schultz seems spectacularly unfit to lead	1
read that the first time with dropping the in clintonomics and came away with totally different picture	1
time for clintonomics reunion deregulation ahoy	1
middle class no question so we have reaganomics readmylips clintonomics deficitsdon tmatterbombiraq and now obamanomics to blame or it was the end of long period of expansion and there is no superpresident who can do shit about it	1
gt so what part of that makes clintonomics disastrous for americans	1
except her statement is wrong they were clearly still marked in the body much to the chagrin of whatever staffer is currently swimming with the fishes thanks to clintonomics	1
the thing with clintonomics was that we didn see the negative repercussions of what he did until bush and obama bill just rode off of the economic prosperity that regan created	1
drug policy is part of whatever clintonomics is	1
have no idea what dates you are talking about you made reference about what happened during and after stating some nonsense about an obama policy stopping the jobs month loss didn want to get to historical debate about the great recession for the same reason don want to debate the great depression because we are obviously from different economic philosophies so simply stated you have an interesting view of the events that unfolded and led up to them if you really want to open that debate that is fine but will start by pointing out the root of the issue was pointed out by senator jon mccain as early as the primaries will warn you this debate is not going to shine clintonomics in good light	1
you have made some solid points with the exception of the tax hikes on those making year politics isn that simple and if you remember correctly bill clinton raised taxes on the middle and lower classes when bush cut everyone taxes the conversation shifted to the millionaires and the middle class was safe when millionaires get tax hikes clintonomics will attack the middle class again which think is not the american way	1
well clintonomics and obamanomics obviously didn fix the problem	1
try playing on high school football team most of my teammates would quote bible verses and engage in team prayer before game on the bus it wasn sanctioned by the coaches but most of them would look away since most of them were southern baptists one of my coaches taught ap economics and despite learning lot from him on economic policy and the benefits of clintonomics he would also go on rant every now and then about how team prayer should be allowed in the locker rooms as liberal as he was on social and fiscal policy he also believed that the government wasn allowing christians to worship freely anymore	1
gt drug policy is part of whatever clintonomics is	1
if the matter were as simple as lone opinion you be right but reality dictates to our knowledge that the washington post is full of establishment types who enjoy the benefits of modified supply-side model clintonomics	1
so what part of that makes clintonomics disastrous for americans	1
and do not forget reaganomics continuation and aggrandizement clintonomics clinton and spouse got the financialization of our economy rolling with grahm-bliley and the end glasssteagle got media consolidation with the fcc act got war on the poor going with welfare reform got more convicts for the for profit prison system with the crime bill got the dem party to turn into neoliberal corporatist party with the dnc only bernie jill stein or maybe trump with millions of engaged citizens helping them can wrest control of our democratic republic from the oligarchs	1
that not the same as clintonomics clinton increased taxes on the wealthy and businesses	1
gt clintonomics was disaster for most americans	1
reaganomics move on over for clintonomics same old shit with different gendered front wo man	1
clintonomics	1
the jokes on you you don have to study clintonomics to be afraid you just have to listen	1
we had our chance to elect progress and we elected the regressive status quo we ll pay for it clintonomics won reagonomics won they re the same	1
yeah no surprise here clintonomics is still trickle down globalization hillary is just as bad as jeb or mitt romney	1
gt we had our chance to elect progress and we elected the regressive status quo we ll pay for it clintonomics won	1
clintonomics give all your money to corporations ll make them to trickle it down to you promise	1
im guessing you were born after the seeing as clinton were the pragmatic progressive outsiders who came to washington and helped the dnc start to actually win we had decades of dems losing non stop and now we ve had the presidency for of the last and soon to be of last years we spent so much time in the fighting over idealistic populism and catering to the needs of corrupt unions that the dnc got destroyed and suddenly years later of pragmatic progressivism and we have had some of the biggest spending increases and social programs since fdr mean it absurd to suggest that clintonomics didn win	1
reaganomics obamanomics clintonomics we probably shouldn treat these platforms with the same linguistic tool we use for celebutante couples just saying it might be bit reductive is all	1
in other words you re fucked because the people you need most by far they all support trump now thanks in no small part to clintonomics and lots of democrats are still allergic to understanding it	1
clintonomics and reaganomics before it gave us the great recession unchecked capitalism turns into cronyism we need more regulations on corporations and the upper strata of wealth not fewer	1
it amazing how much intellectual energy you guys pour into this don deny any of that long history of the residency of various persons of pallor in the british isles translation just proved you wrong so you feel compelled to responded with meaningless mixture of pilpul sophistry pretending to be hurt ally and mere blather race denialism and faith-based belief in the blank slate and the magic dirt is the essence of progressivism you are delusional if you think that non-falsifiable belief in those basic tenets of cultural marxism does not mark you as leftist you seem to be very sensitive about the possibility that someone might suspect you of tribal membership don worry this is the internet-- the realm of ideas we don care if you re self-hating white or mot promoting your own interests it the leftist cant that you spout that must be defeated if the west is to survive	0
yes he would have his masters choose for him because he hopes it will lyin ted doesnt matter he cant win and to just stay in he must win wisconsin none of that matters its all about denialism for you wont find single cruz supporter willing to acknowledge lyin teds shenanigans for its very uncomfortable truth to bear bottom line is if its not trump then it will be none of them the establishment know this and will run with that fine for they still get their snouts on the trough for another eight years regardless of the destruction heaped upon the country	0
yes they are they are your fellow countrymen and women who have hyper emotionally invested in candidate and are now in denialism will keep trying to inform them of the truth will not participate in soundbite arguments with them anymore which gets us nowhere	0
if you build on the scale trump does its impossible without the connections this is standard practice not because trump is crook but politicians are so you wanna talk about shadyness huh some facts about ted cruz ted cruz undisclosed loans from goldman sachs ted cruz dubious citizenship heidi cruz his wife is second in command of goldman sachs one step down from ceo also on the board of the council of foreign relations an organization dedicated to open borders she also sponsored the task force on the future of north america the goal of the itf is full integration of mexico the us and canada in to an eu styled superstate lets meet some of teds campaign team campaign chairman chad sweet former dod cia goldman sachs homeland security sweet co-founded the chertoff group as leader sweet advocated for expanding nsa metadata collection robert pastor another council of foreign relations member who said sovereignty is obsolete canadian and mexican citizens need to be reeducated to view themselves as north americans james woolsey teds foreign policy advisor former director of the cia under the clinton administration he heads up many neoconservative groups dedicated to pushing american military might across the globe elliot abrahams leader of the warmongering necons and of course the leader of the most powerful and pernicious group in the neocon network the council on foreign relations cfr others in his team include more goldman sachs employees more former cia and homeland security dod and cfr other financial backing is coming from big oil tell me why man with these connections and backing is the right man for the american people just one of your cruz supporters convince me if you listed the above as trumps connections campaign team would run mile yet cruz supporters each and every one of you ignore this why answer denialism is person choice to deny reality as way to avoid psychologically uncomfortable truth	0

democratic party because darwinism and climate change are both positions that scientific evidence has verified and anyone can review the evidence- it publicly available they aren churches or religions they aren based on faith you don have faith in anything to know the science of both are sound to call either church would be to commit false equivalence people don believe in global warming or darwinism they assess the evidence and know based on the evidence any other explanation for the results is extremely implausible one doesn have to have faith in anything to accept the evidence of darwiniian evolution proves it to such an extent that you have greater chance of the same person being struck by lightning about times in week and surviving than any other theory than natural selection explaining our present observations will science ever be absolutely certain no but in the same way not absolutely certain that when go to sleep tonight the sun might not just disappear before wake and somehow life on earth miraculously would continue can pretty much rely upon it predictions and make critical life decisions on the basis of it which is something should never do the basis of faith or religion the odds of anything else than natural selection being the truth are truly astronomically small given the strength of the evidence one doesn have to have faith to know that denialism of darwinian evolution and manmade global warming is unsensible and foolish all you have to do is review and understand the evidence no one ever produced one shred of evidence that counts in the sense of not being subjectively interrupted or capable of being explained as proof of any other god or explained some other way not one single shred of solid evidence that qualifies as evidence instead of subjective interpretation for instance of archaeological digs and things we ve found darwin day questions is evolution fact	0

wow what denialism you sound like moderate muslims defending radical muslim isn it interesting how many christians regard the ten commandments as god law which should be followed but oddly only of the commandments are actually law in the us the other would violate the constitution and the american ideals of freedom if they were memorialized as law the only place the other are enforced are in muslim countries that practice sharia law like iraq and afghanistan and to think christians proclaim the commandments as model laws to live by let just hope that the christian taliban is never successful in their effort to institute christian sharia law in the	0

why are they so anxious to close down debate if you want to know more about this read book called merchants of doubt by naomi oreskes and tim conway they detail the methods and personalities involved in climate-change denialism as well as denial of the harms of smoking acid rain no one wants to shut down debate they just want real debate not pr war dressed up as debate above all they want rightly so for denialists to be recognised as such and ignored how come any and all weather events consistent with climate change who saying that explaining the past predicting the future predictions are hard especially ones about the future	0

the democrat party in general has wholly embraced muslims and their ideology and have even gone so far as to make up rationalizations for terrorists who go homicidal and target and harm innocent people both the bernie sanders campaign ultra left embraced muslims as well as hillary active campaign would invite real terrorists father to sit feet from the leading us presidential candidate hell no would not but then also am not in agreement with the democrat stance on islamic terrorism or what appears to be more of an absolute denial that it even exists or is legitimate safety concern don think that would jump to the conclusion that it was hoax because that is another form of denialism of reality denialism in the psychology of human behavior denialism is person choice to deny reality as way to avoid psychologically uncomfortable truth wikipedia so the uncomfortable truth is that there is this massive cult of islam which in spite of the many social and scientific advancements we have as human collective made in this modern age this muslim contingent is actively and strategically waging cultural and religious war against the west and engaging in jihad on massive scale it is happening all over the world on regular basis with much of it not reported in the news	0

your assumption is that system without targets is not necessary because if ukip implemented it immigration would fall and that is perhaps true but what about if labour then become the government they can then adjust the immigration flows without the public really knowing what is going on there is nothing to hold them accountable to hiding it all in commission makes it even easier to abuse immigration control you have thought farage who has railed against an all powerful eu commission that rules over an impotent eu parliament would see the irony of these new immigration proposals but apparently not now if there was ceiling cap target there would be an expectation for any government to set them and in that way we would know what labour was up to and they would be accountable farage made serious mistake yesterday in number of ways the quango and the cap denialism being the most serious errors and even though am ukip member no longer support their immigration policy there is bad smell about it and they need to sort it out quickly before it festers into something rotten	0

you of course resort to de-humanizing condescension and smears of denialism whenever someone calls out your favorite sources for the propaganda they are it not smears when it true you engaged in low-iq ad hominems they donate to democrats therefore their results are inherently useless and have the audacity to claim that my very correct diagnosis of denialism is smear you cannot disprove the right wing history of fascism and nazi germany and its brother in italy by saying american academics donate to democrats in the past few years the mere idea that such ridiculously weak line of reasoning works for you validates my claims against you even if your ego is too inflated by conservative propaganda to accept that will never deny that marxist leninist soviet governments are the definition of th century leftist ideology because do not deny basic facts about history validated by historians of many ideologies countries cultures and generations however to claim that fascism is product of leftists is true absurdity and to defend your claims by demagoguing against historians across the world with your donation angle is pathetic	0

why is it christians verses gay people why wouldn you want to work it out with your fellow american rather than take them down what is odd is that the court found that christians were discriminating against gays and that christians had violated the th amendment don know one incident where christian has taken your lively hood away because they disagree you are very wrong you must be kidding if you don think that christians boycott business all the time and file lawsuits to impose their will on others here are just few of the problems with christianity it has fought to prevent the development of life saving medical treatments such as embryonic stem cell research prevent woman from exercising their right to choose in direct contradiction to the constitution teach the christian religion in public schools disguised as intelligent design or otherwise in direct contravention of the constitution there is an interesting nova episode on this you can also watch very interesting youtube video entitled ken miller on intelligent design which goes into great detail about the federal court case that addressed the issue turn this country into christian nation when it is nation of all religions this has to do with the ten commandment cases crucifix cases and school prayer most religions are doomsday cults forty-four percent of christians believe that jesus will return during their life time and bring about the cataclysmic end of the universe this is not healthy state of mind of large segment of our population and could evolve into self fulfilling prophesy control the election process casting votes based on values rooted in superstition as opposed to fact and reason convince millions of sub-saharan africans country ravaged by aids that they will burn in hell for all eternity if they use condoms clinically proven and highly effective means of preventing the spread of the deadly disease deny gays equal protection and equal rights under the constitution reject sound scientific understanding such as evolution and global warming on religious grounds as opposed to scientific grounds such denialism will have profound impact on life and could ultimately lead to unnecessary death and suffering of millions if anything they go out of their way to be kind all they want is to be able to live by their convictions deeply held convictions we are in this together see above why your comment is not supported by the evidence just because it law which five year old could come up with law-it not rocket science doesn give anyone the right to take anther persons god given right to their freedoms and liberties away from them cuz it doesn align with theirs was anyone preventing christians from praying or reading the bible or going to church or sacrificing sheep yours and my forefathers fought for our liberties and freedom of religion free speech and pursuit of happiness who is stopping you from practicing your superstitious beliefs who is stoping gay people from getting married the court ruled that christians are wrong and that they are the ones discriminating against gays get your facts straight you are spitting on all those grave sights at arlington no you are they fought to uphold the constitution and you are not honoring it that is exactly what the court found do you have no respect for the constitution and our government you are spitting on them saying free to have my rights but if someone else rights irritate me and make me feel uncomfortable will take them down with the courts because my rights are more important than theirs by law that even five year old could come up with wrong it is you that has no respect for our constitution by your logic if it law that automatically means it the right thing to do by your logic you are the standard of what is right and the christians are the standard of what is wrong your statement makes no sense you either honor the constitution or you don the supreme court has declared what rights the constitution protects that is its job per the constitution it did this exactly as the constitution and subsequent court cases mandate if you refuse to accept how our government actually works you are the one who is unamerican and intolerant so basically what saying by this new law is that there are no more standards for what is right or what is wrong what are you talking about we dont live in theocracy your god has no say in how our government operates anything goes wrong the court is very specific in its opinion and if we question anything goes standard then that person is by your definition of right and wrong wrong the constitution determines what goes and what is right and wrong and the courts job per the constitution is to interpret it just as it did so it not about liberties anymore it about controlling people if you disagree so before this so called law gay people in america were getting their lively hood taken away christians were taking gay people to court and suing them for being gay of thousands dollars because they disagree in their convictions christians sued people for gayness you are missing the entire issue which is about christians depriving gays their equal protection rights you should read the court opinion so you actually have clue what you are talking about so if people disagree with you you are going to force them to like what you re doing you are going to force people you live with to like you non sequitur so no more god in america you can have all the gods you want in america just not in our government is that your final answer no more of god laws cuz he doesn exist anyway your gods laws violate the constitution we don live in theocracy if you want that move to iraq sharia law is gods law your gods law would be no different friend of mine was watching the big bang theory he said did you know that the can laughter used on the show was from the he said ya those people laughing are dead they aren living we are listening to dead people laugh thought how weird but true ooookkjaaa	0
karma is just superstitious belief it is also called bad luck as for live and let live it would be great if christians keep their superstitious beliefs to themselves here are the ways they interfere with the freedoms of others prevent the development of life saving medical treatments such as embryonic stem cell research prevent woman from exercising their right to choose in direct contradiction to the constitution teach the christian religion in public schools disguised as intelligent design or otherwise in direct contravention of the constitution there is an interesting nova episode on this you can also watch very interesting youtube video entitled ken miller on intelligent design which goes into great detail about the federal court case that addressed the issue turn this country into christian nation when it is nation of all religions this has to do with the ten commandment cases crucifix cases and school prayer most religions are doomsday cults forty-four percent of christians believe that jesus will return during their life time and bring about the cataclysmic end of the universe this is not healthy state of mind of large segment of our population and could evolve into self fulfilling prophesy control the election process casting votes based on values rooted in superstition as opposed to fact and reason convince millions of sub-saharan africans country ravaged by aids that they will burn in hell for all eternity if they use condoms clinically proven and highly effective means of preventing the spread of the deadly disease deny gays equal protection and equal rights under the constitution reject sound scientific understanding such as evolution and global warming on religious grounds as opposed to scientific grounds such denialism will have profound impact on life and could ultimately lead to unnecessary death and suffering of millions	0

npr went off the rails many years ago used to listen to them and even donate to them long long time ago no more they don even bother to pretend to be objective anymore germany and much of the rest of europe will eventually reap sorry reward for allowing all these muslims into their countries it simply not sustainable from humanitarian point of view it seems noble but the political and financial fallout from it will be severe none of these countries have the money to keep these migrants on the government dole for long and migrants don speak the local language are not educated and have little to no relevant skills that make them employable just watch and see by next year many of these european nations will be begging the imf for loans and all of them will eventually go the way of greece---including germany this on top of the inevitable cultural backlash and increasing crime non-muslims will be constantly yielding and kissing muslim butt if you have the opportunity definitely go to sweden to see what cultural suicide and the purposeful destruction of western nation looks like the liberal whites there hate themselves so much that it scary to watch them go on and on about extremist multiculturalist ideals they refuse to even acknowledge the skyrocketing rapes and other crimes being committed by muslims against whites in that country and they accuse anyone who mentions these things of being racist believe in freedom and live and let live up to point but when it starts to get all ridiculous with the self-hate stuff just turn it off when you purposefully fail to appreciate your heritage your gifts and your blessings then you deserve to lose them large-scale muslim immigration is not good thing in western cultures europe has very long and bloody history of how this was tried and failed badly in the past the socialists have forgotten all about their history and are making the same mistake all over again	0
all of those are good reasons but it not going to stop the muslim population boom it not going to deter the asian rape gangs and it not going to stop terror either it will only make the streets of london look nicer it will only eventually dupe us into thinking this fifth column has finally assimilated and integrated which think we both know will never be the case see these bans as another exercise in denial and self-delusion last ditch effort to prop up dying multiculturalist ideology still clinging in vain to the belief that these horrendous dangerous subversive people can actually become british the country isn made of magic dirt some things are impossible	0

wondered about this for long time too believe the answer is held in the bigoted root notions of multiculturalism anything people from another society do can be explained away with this notion islam is different but equal to our own culture therefore we cannot judge people from muslim societies the way we judge our own to do so is imposing our cultural understandings on to them which to the multiculturalist is double standard all we can do is try to better our own society which strangely after being bettered is still equal to all other societies ve never seen anyone try to square that circle since we don understand each other we cannot judge another culture and since we will never understand their culture there no point in doing anything other than just accepting what they do as normal within their own society therefore what they do we must accept otherwise we re being xenophobic due to ignorance of their culture further anything they do to us which we deem unacceptable we must tolerate because the root cause of their actions is clash of societies where we consciously and unconsciously have tried to force them to accept our values western oppression and they are quite naturally and understandably lashing out at us based on their societal norms and our attempts to impose our set of norms on them if only we understood this terrorism would stop now think multiculturalism is nothing more than cover for bigotry when you dig deep enough into these people thought process what you find is that western oppression is code for christianity and judaism which these people believe are two of the darkest forces in the world you will note that the same people who promote this crap also tend to be the israel is terrorist nation and the poor palestinians are their victims and any time israel defends itself it crime they also love to talk about christian terrorists shooting abortion doctors as if that happens two or three times week these people are in my mind quite literally insane they re so filled with hate for christians and jews that they will say and do anything to further the goal of harming said christians and jews including embracing completely repugnant behavior hate has driven them utterly mad	0
honestly don think so his comment is filled with pc crap and then he has the nerve to accuse me of being pc and multiculturalist whatever that means he then tells us all that it only tiny minority without any proof at all that are jihadis when even if it were tiny minority of muslims say it would still be people dedicated to murdering or subjugating everyone not muslim lunatic like themselves and is vastly underrated number the reality is much much larger than that and at that probably much larger number while not actually violent maniacs tacitly approve of the maniac goals personally pretty sick of hearing about the religion of peace	0

perhaps if europe is so suicidal that it wishes to commit suicide by islam despite the absolutely incontrovertible evidence that muslims will in almost all cases refuse to assimilate refuse to learn the language of their new homelands or even enter the homes of non-muslims then it is time to just write them off as lost cause and quit caring for one am sick of reading these type of patently stupid stories about germany austria sweden ad nauseum they are all the same muslim immigrants welcomed muslin immigrants rape young boys girls and women and even the occasional man and or rob and or murder rabid socialist idiots running germany austria sweden etc decry racist islamophobic fact based reporting of fact based reports of immigrant rampages because they don service their multiculturalist government leader agendas main steam media being nothing more than lap dogs for the likes of merkel lap it up like tasty gravy on their dog food with absolutely no regard nor caring about journalistic integrity or telling the public the truth cut to tomorrow replay of today day in day out same old same ol chicken ala little or bit of let cry wolf once again anyone sometimes countries just need to be allowed to die if that is their choice for one am officially giving up on europe apparently the socialists got their way they conditioned the manhood and womanhood and natural human imperative for self-survival completely out of all europe boys and girls and substituted their intellectual conceits and pretenses their politically correct overlay of kumbaya socialistic pretensions for reality in their minds thus of course all the easier my dears to divorce you from reality by allowing you no anchor in the here and now that is real and solid how better to make it so we can ever so easily manipulate you now and forever and day after all boys and girls of europe resistance is futile and we have won imagine no more borders and we all can live as one	0

multiculturalism when will the sleeper wake london mayor boris johnson spoke the other day about the riots that devastated london and other english cities last summer the biggest shock for me from the riots was the sheer sense of nihilism perhaps should not have been shocked but in my view literacy and numeracy are the best places to start in seven particular boroughs in london one in four children are leaving functionally illiterate in few schools it is nearer we have to intervene at an earlier stage and think the mayor can help the new york times said on tuesday march the subject is the shootings at school in toulouse france the previous day the victims were jewish but the gunman identity was unknown so the times defaulted to basic liberal assumptions the political debate around the shootings and whether the deaths of an instructor and three young children were somehow inspired by anti-immigrant political talk is likely to continue in the middle of long and heated presidential campaign with president nicolas sarkozy trying to win back disaffected supporters who have drifted to the far-right national front party the shootings at toulouse have raised new questions about the tone and tenor of the debate here about what it is to be french here is thing that general wesley clark then the supreme commander of the nato alliance said back in the subject was the nato bombing of serbia cultural diversity within nation causes nothing but trouble what could be more obvious there is no place in modern europe for ethnically pure states that th century idea and we are trying to transition into the st century and we are going to do it with multi-ethnic states the common thread there is multiculturalism the notion that entire populations of different cultures can coexist in reasonable harmony together under common sovereignty in europe and the anglosphere this is the age of multiculturalism an age when the doctrine is so much taken for granted at least by elite types such as the mayor of london editorial writers at the new york times and american generals that it has seeped into the tissues and bones to the degree that contrary notions cannot be thought my three quotes all illustrate that the mayor of london cannot think the following thought last summer riots were initially and essentially race riots with what is left of england native underclass only joining in later as scavengers as for functionally illiterate well across the boroughs that make up inner london there are schoolchildren whose first language is not english compared to just native english speakers so the dismal educational outcomes the mayor cites were not the cause of the riots rather both london mass functional illiteracy and the riots are effects of common cause fifty years of insane immigration policies turning the capital into tower of babel while simultaneously gifting it with beauties like these multiculturalism horrible consequences can this fool mayor tells us be cured with little extra algebra the thought that new york times editorialists cannot think about anti-semitic murders in europe is that jew-killing has nothing to do with anti-immigrant political talk or the far right it is instead an activity favored encouraged and committed pretty exclusively by radical muslims who have been admitted to europe in ululating multitudes by the same lunatic multiculturalist immigration policies that gave london its riots here the thought that general clark could not think far from being discredited th-century relic the ethno-state has been the very foundation of europe long post-ww ii peace the multiculturalist assault on ethno-nationalism will return europe to strife conflict and national instability in the year hundred years on from general clark pronouncement all three of those quotations will sound chimerical reading them our great-grandchildren will shake their heads in wonder couldn they see cultural diversity within nation causes nothing but trouble what could be more obvious in that future world nations that had the sense to remain ethnically intact and which had arctic distributions of intelligence behavior and personality china japan korea presumably united by then finland maybe israel if she survives just possibly russia some outlier oddities such as perhaps hungary will have steamed ahead of those who inflicted the multi-culti blight upon themselves the rest of us will either be dragging ourselves along wearily towing behind us the millstones of unproductive unassimilable low-human-capital subpopulations left over from the age of multiculturalism along with the associated frictions and rancors or else we shall have broken up in complete ethnic disaggregation casting off those subpopulations to fend for themselves in mini-states of their own while we join rejoin really the ethno-nationalist march of mankind historians of the future will amuse themselves by coming up with theories to explain why european civilization at the height of its powers rich with unparalleled achievements in science music art literature mathematics and technology gave up its lands and its treasures to people for whom those achievements were mere hated tokens of oppression or the impious and superfluous productions of infidels for those of us living through the age of multiculturalism the interesting question is when will the sleeper wake when will the obvious become undeniable even to those as sheltered and blinkered as boris johnson and new york times staffers given the well-nigh unlimited human capacity for self-deception and wishful thinking together with the power of unanimous elites to enforce their version of reality on distracted populace my guess is that we have decade or two to go multiculturalism is barely half century old soviet communism lasted seventy-four years	0
it didn even need to go into motion at this point just to test out the theory of multiculturalism but guess some people think that mistake needs to be made before people wise up get the idea there is no amount of tolerance peace messages that will stop islamic terrorism no matter how you want to label it as just lone wolves those lone wolves are literally killing people and leaving behind rather heavy priced body count it proven even further that no matter how strict the gun laws are they still find ways of committing these acts of terror sorry but nothing that the left has tried is working understand that people don want to judge whole culture of people to reflect on the group as whole for the actions of few you ve been giving them chance after chance and no it not the fault of people who are openly speaking out against muslims that causing this it not the fault of offending them they ve been committing acts of terror against themselves for generations since the birth of muhammads islam the sunni shiite daesh all of the muslims islam sects have been at it for the past years amongst themselves long before we opened our doors in an attempt to prove study of multiculturalist theory through messages of peace tolerance you re just not going to get it the only way it can happen is if something with islam itself changes they are not going to assimilate because doing so in their religion makes them apostates and apostasy in islam means death many of them might be willing to assimilate if their religion did not consider assimilation as apostasy and even then you still have the problem of how it does not tolerate adultery homosexuality nor the laws of other cultures because it isn islam without sharia law what needs to happen for islam is new testament more tolerant one one that is just as tolerant peace-loving as christianity no more honor-killing no more sentences punishable by death no more worship of muhammad no more getting offended if someone draws muhammad no more rape no more genital mutilations of women no more pedophilia if they are unwilling to give all of that up then islam is lost cause and would consider islam to be thing that is just predestined by similar theory of natural selection to just die out at some point islam is just incompatible with western civilization	0

the power of the leftist green agenda isn based in its appeal to the masses in truth the vast majority of people in the west do not care enough to make it political issue at election time in britain at least the issues causing concern for the majority of people are much more realistic and concerned mainly with the economy and immigration on those issues the left have nothing to say because they know they are at odds with the wishes of the majority what the left has done in britain is use the education system to breed class of social science graduates who were ready to move into positions of influence when labour won the election the years following that win allowed the left to cement their position in all sorts of diverse areas such as quangos and the civil service to name but two if david davis had won the tory leadership contest instead of david cameron it is highly likely that he would have cleared the decks so to speak and replaced many of the leading lights of the left with real conservatives instead we got cameron who is by his own admission blairite and has left all of those people in place the problem faced by the left now is popular rejection of their frankly extreme anti nationalist multiculturalist dogma in britain the liberal pm is beset on all sides by problems that all relate to the idea that the establishment has forgotten it should represent the will of the people it has gotten so bad for centre left conservatism and centre left labourism that both parties have been fractured and are being pulled away from the centre by events outside their control so far the right is looking like it will be the beneficiary of this uncertain period of politics that has been caused wholly by the left all the right needs to do is use the next period of power to remove the left wing influencers from positions of authority and replace them with people more favourable to our cause once the right has control of the levers of power the green issue will become protest issue for smelly students and the public won care one bit	0
funny comment just heard vince cable on the bbc tripping over his multiculturalist defence by suggesting the cologne rapefest could have been organised by right wing extremists	0
hi thanks for replying you took your time though and this safe space is bit cramped lol re moderate muslims they do exist ve known few after was robbed in jerusalem was waiting in line for public phone muslim in front of me said how are you and when said not too great actually ve been robbed the guy responded with am muslim you are my brother and proceeded to press cash on me to help me out was ok but to refuse would have been almost impolite am saying this because want islam in the uk heck no and the moderates provide the ocean in which the fundamentalist sharks swim but my point is they re not all sleepers so we are imho discussing the deportation of innocents black culture may lack coherent totalitarian ideology but blacks have all-too-readily jumped aboard the multiculturalist anti-racist ideology to further their aims and anti-racism or to describe it accurately anti-white racism is distinctly totalitarian unless you think whites losing their job for wrong think or being denied job because of affirmative action or having to attend brainwashing diversity seminars etc is reasonable this may not represent threat as violent as islam but in the future who knows in the us anti-white racist rhetoric is reaching fever pitch and seeing the resurgence of the black panthers etc the hispanics have la raza the race and we are already seeing ratcheting up of non-white totalitarianism on universities here the answer as you ve already pointed out is the total dismantling of political correctness which is after all self-loathing white ideology not black one or is it it could be argued that anti-racism is so entrenched in black culture it has become part of it whatever the answer identifying with your ethnic group or race is considered perfectly normal and natural around the world except by western whites which is why blacks and other non-white groups seized so readily upon the useful anti-racist ideology in the first place and why we saw them form organisations such as the black police officers association etc as such non-whites will be forever be agitating in the interests of their own group whether the vehicle of political correctness is there or not and the more you import the more assertive they feel as group and the greater the agitating becomes there is reason why multi-racial states don really exist in nature they are inherently unstable and lead to conflict another factor to consider is the disproportionate levels of welfare dependancy for certain non-white groups this aspect of black and other non-white culture may not be particularly hostile but it will inevitably result in casualties as the non-white population grows and the welfare state collapses eventually we ll reach the stage of your kid needs an operation sorry there no money and the reality of mass third world immigration whether islamic or non becomes very stark indeed know you ve said above that welfare should be stopped not sure if you meant generally or just for criminals but no amount of training and education will fix this problem ll just get my safe space ready and point out that googling something along the lines of world map by average iq might tell you why to conclude just trying to point out that non-muslim third world immigration has been and will continue to be disaster almost as much as muslim immigration hence me pointing out black crime stats lest anybody thinking that importing persecuted christians from the me or africa would necessarily be much better also arguing that in addition to identifying as infidels whites in the uk need to identify in terms of race just like the black police officers association does we have every right to avoid our homeland becoming third world whether of the islamic variety or not anyway hope you see this and give it some thought cheers	0

apologies for the length of this post it is relevant to this article am nationalist not right-wing thug not fascist not just patriot but nationalist believe in the fundamental primacy of the nation state its sovereignty not just for our nation but for all nations what does this mean it is quite simple to explain anyone can understand it it means three main things nation has the right to govern itself without hindrance from without nation government has primary duty to retain that power of governance the maintenance of the combined body of common law and legislated statutes regardless of external civil or military pressure to abandon any element of that framework for conduct within the nation nation has the right at all times to seek its own independent negotiated relationship with any other sovereign nation its government has no right to negotiate any agreement on its behalf which would prejudice the nation sovereignty including its right to withdraw from any bilateral multinational or global agreement at some future time nation has the absolute right to maintain effective borders to defend them at all times against military attack and to regulate the flow of civil traffic across those borders it has the absolute right to determine residency of those who wish to enter its territory no government may take any action which would prejudice these rights as nationalist believe not only in our own right to self-determination and sovereign independence also believe in those rights for all nation states am better friend to other nations than all the multinationalists and internationalists put together respect the right of other nations to practise their own culture behind secure national boundaries in this am true multiculturalist respect their right to the peaceful enjoyment of their realm and their right to combat external tyranny whether it is by military threat or by civil invasion respect their right to national legal and cultural framework their historical continuity and their right to negotiate directly with my own nation for our mutual benefit in trading commerce and cooperation for security to be nationalist is not to be fascist it is the opposite and is the only form of patriotism that is wholly unhypocritical it opposes tyranny both international and within the sovereign state it cleaves entirely to the principle that government is answerable to the people it serves it believes that the sovereign nation state is the perfect the only balance between power and accountability it is the fons et origo of the consenting framework which is necessary for true democracy however it is practised however it refuses to interfere in the internal workings of other nation states on the belief that sovereignty is indivisible and disparate cultures have right to exist behind national boundaries our nation is being dissolved before our very eyes to belong to sovereign nation is the most precious public possession person can have and it is being taken from us by process of insidious civil usurpation and the actions of believers in internationalism and globalism as believer in democracy know that its only true form is national one democracy is built on consent consent relies on trust and trust is only built up in nation by centuries-long process of cultural continuity and historical agreement wherever there is sudden flux of population this process is disrupted and may be permanently maimed whether this deliberate or accidental consequence of today globalism that is what is happening in our nation today we have to put stop to it or the long achievement of our nationhood will be swept aside and we will be living in an outpost of somebody else tyranny	0
aye it true all us swedish men came to the conclusion this summer that rape is much more cooling than chilled beer and swim ll give the state credit though at least they invented new bs excuse instead of just spewing out the worn out excuse that more women are pressing charges rape has always been this high it sad before the only precautions women needed to take in sweden was the standard don walk alone at night in cities don accept drinks from strangers and as kids don go along with strangers now the list also has don pick mushrooms in the forest don smile while looking in the general direction of muslim man don go swimming don go outdoors if your town has refugee housing really just don leave the house things aren exactly getting any better seeing how many swedes are afraid to help when they see foreigner attacking someone it certainly doesn help that the state has turned your average swedish woman into an insane culturally suicidal multiculturalist and that it seems to take at least half decade for student to go through the detox required to see through the lies of the propaganda machine that is public school at this point it only feels like matter of time before those of us against this crap give up on the democratic process and take things truly into our own hands and seeing as how the police is declining into near nonexistence don see how the state can stop it	0

since immediately after the civil war america began to accept huge numbers of immigrants in order to fuel her reconstruction industrial revolution and her economic growth these immigrants realized that they were escaping their old countries because those countries had failed them and embraced the idea of assimilating into american culture because of those selfsame reasons the numbers of immigrants that came here contributed to the economic growth and increased power of america which are responsible for the high quality of life we enjoy today because those immigrants assimilated and became part of the fabric of our country those immigrants were able to blend into the american tapestry precisely because they endeavored to assimilate conversely the multiculturalist democrat ideal that new immigrants needn assimilate does nothing but foster resentment by both the immigrants and the native citizenry and encourage those immigrants to import the very same attitudes that were responsible for their old countries failing them multiculturalism is therefore recipe for turning america into melange of all the failed third-world countries of the world without any unique cultural links to bind people as cohesive society mr khan own ideas identify him as either manchurian candidate or complete idiot there are no other choices just because immigrants assimilate does not and has not signaled rejection of the traditions that make them who they are traditions generally became traditional because they were good the inevitable results of policies and corruption similar to what the democrat party has offered america for the past fifty years were the reasons the societies from which immigrants to america failed those people and from which they are trying to escape	0

co-creator lucas dixon argued that the team wanted to let communities have the discussions they want to have there are already plenty of nasty places on the internet what we can do is create places where people can have better conversations dixon claimed which greenberg noted was favoring sanitized internet over freewheeling one in other words what they want to create are echo chambers where people can actively avoid being confronted with opposing points of view let alone engage with them elsewhere on this site there is report on vile pro-immigration multiculturalist propaganda video made by swedish immigration charity where they insist that swedes must integrate with the immigrant cultures and languages and that sweden can never go back to how it once was read through the twitter responses to the video thank you google translate that one thing you ve yet to ruin and most of them are extremely harsh and vitriolic and some are downright racist anti-semitic or offensive but that is the response that the video provoked the real response and such was the vitriol that it received the charity was forced to clarify the message behind their video and engage with criticisms of it if they had had filtering tool such as those google are creating then they could have simply blocked out most of the criticism and gone on blindly ignoring the anger and resentment they were stirring up in people who didn appreciate their message or the way in which it was presented they still don fully acknowledge it but at least they were confronted with reality and not sanitized filtered version the truth is that on most platforms people already have the means to filter out people and conversations they re not interested in they can block people report messages and accounts to moderators change their settings to allow only friends to contact them message people privately and so on the only purpose of filter that automatically censors what you see on the internet and who or how people engage with you is to suppress alternative points of view while protecting and reinforcing your own and ignore the real reaction your conversations provoke	0

misogyny that hardly relevant here would argue that it is more matter of unabashed political hypocrisy on the part of the american feminist community or what about the kind of contradictory double standards that the multiculturalist rank and file so love to embrace am as much for equal rights as the next person but when the rhetoric doesn match the action when criticism only flows in some directions and not in others and when the feminist ideology becomes inexplicably apologetic when dealing with muslims then any person has the right to suspect that something other than trailblazing concern for equal rights is afoot	0

the eu is certainly turning back the clock with their weak kneed policy of forever grovelling in the vain hope of appeasing the islamic bullies muslim pirates were constant threat in the mediterranean from the seventh century onwards right up until the nineteenth century preying upon merchant vessels and raiding coastal settlements in search of slaves people on the islands in particular lived in constant fear of the muslim slavers appearing over the horizon as admiral parry says we are now heading back towards those times because the powers that be lack the courage to defend the shores of europe being too frightened of being thought to be racist just as the spineless authorities in britain have turned blind eye to the activities of islamic rape gangs preferring to condemn young girls to horrific abuse rather than challenge their multiculturalist sensibilities so the lily-livered eu will permit slave raids rather than take firm action to prevent them	0

answer my last question what is your ideology afraid to share think you are the kind of multiculturalist marxist who thinks cutting little girls is okay cause its part of some muslim cultures any immigrant group that can take criticism without resorting to violence should be deported not standing up to muslims in dearborn and exercising free speech to confront and criticize their intolerance will result in enclaves of sharia law that do not recognize our constitution islam is geopolitical death cult that seeks only to dominate the world teachings of taqiyya fitra and jihad are their admission of this fact you speak of playing with fire however that fire will grow until it scorches americans who ve been avoiding the blaze you islam and sharia will take parasitic root if they are not confounded early and often the founding fathers knew the insidiousness of islam from our barbary wars on the shores of tripoli death cults do not have constitutional protection but afraid it will take islamic terror bombings in michigan for you to open your eyes	0

what we re seeing is anarcho-tyranny what we have in this country today then is both anarchy the failure of the state to enforce the laws and at the same time tyranny the enforcement of laws by the state for oppressive purposes the criminalization of the law-abiding and innocent through exorbitant taxation bureaucratic regulation the invasion of privacy and the engineering of social institutions such as the family and local schools the imposition of thought control through sensitivity training and multiculturalist curricula hate crime laws gun-control laws that punish or disarm otherwise law-abiding citizens but have no impact on violent criminals who get guns illegally and vast labyrinth of other measures in word anarcho-tyranny francis argues that this situation extends across the and europe while the government functions normally violent crime remains constant creating climate of fear anarchy he says that laws that are supposed to protect ordinary citizens against ordinary criminals routinely go unenforced even though the state is perfectly capable of doing so while this problem rages on government elites concentrate their interests on law-abiding citizens in fact middle america winds up on the receiving end of both anarchy and tyranny the laws that are enforced are either those that extend or entrench the power of the state and its allies and internal elites or else they are the laws that directly punish those recalcitrant and pathological elements in society who insist on behaving according to traditional norms people who do not like to pay taxes wear seat belts or deliver their children to the mind-bending therapists who run the public schools or the people who own and keep firearms display or even wear the confederate flag put up christmas trees spank their children and quote the constitution or the bible not to mention dissident political figures who actually run for office and try to do something about mass immigration by third world populations francis argued that anarcho-tyranny is built into the managerial system and cannot be solved simply by fighting corruption or voting out incumbents in fact he says that the system generates false conservatism that encourages people to act passively in the face of perpetual revolution he concludes that only by devolving power back toward law-abiding citizens can sanity be restored	0

not sure why you want to start with the multiculturalist maxim don believe that as christian also don believe christians must be as bad if not worse so it seems to me you are trying to make straw horse argument know that is enticing to you because those arguments are so easy to win ve presented much different argument which is that the idea that people who come to the united states must adopt our western values is wrong first of all as have discussed in an earlier post we don force hasidic jews the amish or other groups to fully assimilate think that is an incontrovertible fact so now lets bring the discussion to islam believe that anyone who immigrates to our country permanently or temporarily has to live within our laws however that doesn mean they have to dress like us or live like us or fully adopt western culture mean here in the us lot of parents let their teenage daughters dress up like prostitutes and go hang out with their friends one of the more recent ideas is to have coed sleepovers doesn that sound like fun for teenage boys and girls if someone chooses not to assimilate to that culture does that make them someone who shouldn be allowed to live in the us don think so before you start talking about beheading criminals and stoning of gays and adulterous women let me stipulate that we cannot be tolerant of those actions in our nation but do you seriously believe that any muslim who opposes gay marriage or believes his sons and daughters shouldn participate in premarital sex shouldn be allowed to immigrate to the us	0
have better idea proceeding from the multiculturalist maxim that all cultures are relatively equal do simple google or bing or your choice of engine for muslim beheadings view the quite extensive and graphic results then because christians must be just as bad if not worse after all multiculturalism cannot be wrong can it do search using again your choice of engines for christian beheadings do be sure to carefully analyze the results and report back with your findings sure you ll be as surprised as was the only caveat is this no killings by anyone during the crusades matter	0

the rot in rotherham scandal involving rape ethnicity religion and the willful failure of britain public authorities to protect thousands of girls from horrific exploitation has become international news but while some of the revelations of the barbarities practiced in the town of rotherham in south yorkshire and elsewhere in england are fresh the story is not new it has taken some years for this scandal to reach critical mass and get the attention of the british political class this delay was due to toxic combination of pathologies on the part of the authorities and the british media and it all boiled down to deliberate and even bizarrely principled refusal to speak the truth no matter the consequences to the innocent these pathologies include endemic official terror of seeming racist or being labeled as such an obsession with not giving ammunition to the country weak and tiny extreme right the requirement that all liberal middle-class british people ignore or pretend not to see any negative fallout from mass immigration and the persistence of multiculturalist dogma that prescribes morally relativistic response to cultural difference coming to town near you	0

will you not fight people who have violated their oaths pagans of makkah and intended to expel the messenger while they did attack you first do you fear them all has more right that you should fear him if you are believers what oath did the byzantines violate when did they intend to expell moe from mekkah who did when did the byzantines attack moe first who did how can there be covenant with all and with his messenger for the mushrik polytheists idolaters pagans disbelievers in the oneness of all except those with whom you made covenant near al-masjid-al-har at makkah so long as they are true to you stand you true to them verily all loves al-muttaq the pious see who did moe have treaty with made at mekkah was it the byzantines or the mekkans hudabiya it is not for the mushrik polytheists idolaters pagans disbelievers in the oneness of all to maintain the mosques of all to pray and worship all therein to look after their cleanliness and their building etc while they witness against their ownselves of disbelief the works of such are in vain and in fire shall they abide were the byzantines doing that or was it the mekkans you who believe take not for auliy supporters and helpers your fathers and your brothers if they prefer disbelief to belief and whoever of you does so then he is one of the lim wrong-doers etc did moe companions have fathers and brothers in the roman province of syria or were their relatives in mekkah if is about the pagans of mekkah why does the very next verse curse jews christians if it was the mekkans to be attacked in he be cursing them in why are the next four verses wasted in demonizing jews christians if the mekkan pagans are the object of the verb fight in islamic law is the koran and sunnah the codes of the shafi hanafi maliki schools of islamic law agree on the need to ivite victims to islam prior to attacking you can not discredit that with vacuous accertions show some evidence nor do they tread path which enrages the unbelievers nor do they attain from the enemy what they attain but good work is written down to them on account of it enrage has matches anger has matches in at islam awakened injury has matches righteous has matches and good deed has matches now by allah exhibit proof that the verse does not clearly mean what it says	0
kill the mushrik see wherever you find them abrogation is verse by verse not surah by surah read standing up to relieve pressure on yer brain islamic law confirms the clear meaning of the jihad imperatives	0
you began with the seventh so will begin with the first freedom from all obligations is declared from all and his messenger to those of the mushrik polytheists pagans idolaters disbelievers in the oneness of all with whom you made treaty so travel freely mushrik see for four months as you will throughout the land but know that you cannot escape from the punishment of all and all will disgrace the disbelievers and declaration from all and his messenger to mankind on the greatest day the th of dhul-hijjah the th month of isl mic calendar that all is free from all obligations to the mushrik see and so is his messenger so if you mushrik repent it is better for you but if you turn away then know that you cannot escape from the punishment of all and give tidings muhammad of painful torment to those who disbelieve except those of the mushrik with whom you have treaty and who have not subsequently failed you in aught nor have supported anyone against you so fulfill their treaty to them to the end of their term surely all loves al- mattaq the pious see then when the sacred months the ist th th and th months of the isl mic calendar have passed then kill the mushrik see wherever you find them and capture them and besiege them and prepare for them each and every ambush but if they repent and perform as-sal iq mat-as-sal and give zak then leave their way free verily all is oft-forgiving most merciful and if anyone of the mushrik polytheists idolaters pagans disbelievers in the oneness of all seeks your protection then grant him protection so that he may hear the word of all the qur and then escort him to where he can be secure that is because they are men who know not treaties abrogated specifically hudabaya with ten year term after three years when his army was sufficient for conquest of the city when the sacred months are passed we will whack you redundant warning flagrant conflict with fighting in the sacred months was taboo among the arabs but moe said fitna was worse and did it anyway kill them wherever you find them is clear beyond any reasonable doubt fess up or get out moe had subverted yatthrib built up an army financed it with the proceeds of caravan raids and was ready to attack mekkah these verses both threaten the mekkans and rouse the rabble to raid them ibn kathir tafsir of surah at-taubah begins here how does it differ from the obvious meaning of the verses tafsir al-jalalayn of at-taubah begins here use it for comparison you started short of the beginning of the chapter and stopped short of the most important verse in those verses you left out moe is demonizing the pagans and rousing the rabble urging them to participate in the attack he even tells them to abandon parents and siblings who do not embrace islam mekkans derived much of their income from providing goods and services to pilgrims visiting the kaaba they feard loss of income if paganism was disrupted and pilgrimages ended in moe reassures them allah will provide spoils and jizya to replace their lost income you who believe in all oneness and in his messenger muhammad verily the mushrik polytheists pagans idolaters disbelievers in the oneness of all and in the message of muhammad are najasun impure so let them not come near al-masjid-al-har at makkah after this year and if you fear poverty all will enrich you if he will out of his bounty surely all is all-knowing all-wise those first verses can be considered an extension of al-anfal particularly cuz there is no bismillah to begin the chapter now the subject changes to people of the book was about war on pagans to death or islam is about war on jews christians until subjugation extortion fight against those who believe not in all nor in the last day nor forbid that which has been forbidden by all and his messenger and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth isl among the people of the scripture jews and christians until they pay the jizyah with willing submission and feel themselves subdued moe continues demonizing his intended victims then he threatens shirkers with the fire for not marching on tobuk with him and the jews say uzair ezra is the son of all and the christians say messiah is the son of all that is saying from their mouths they imitate the saying of the disbelievers of old all curse be on them how they are deluded away from the truth they jews and christians took their rabbis and their monks to be their lords besides all by obeying them in things which they made lawful or unlawful according to their own desires without being ordered by all and they also took as their lord messiah son of maryam mary while they jews and christians were commanded in the taur torah and the injeel gospel to worship none but one il god all il ha illa huwa none has the right to be worshipped but he praise and glory be to him far above is he from having the partners they associate with him they the disbelievers the jews and the christians want to extinguish all light with which muhammad has been sent isl mic monotheism with their mouths but all will not allow except that his light should be perfected even though the fir disbelievers hate it it is he who has sent his messenger muhammad with guidance and the religion of truth isl to make it superior over all religions even though the mushrik polytheists pagans idolaters disbelievers in the oneness of all hate it you who believe verily there are many of the jewish rabbis and the christian monks who devour the wealth of mankind in falsehood and hinder them from the way of all all religion of isl mic monotheism and those who hoard up gold and silver al-kanz the money the zak of which has not been paid and spend it not in the way of all announce unto them painful torment on the day when that al-kanz money gold and silver etc the zak of which has not been paid will be heated in the fire of hell and with it will be branded their foreheads their flanks and their backs and it will be said unto them this is the treasure which you hoarded for yourselves now taste of what you used to hoard verily the number of months with all is twelve months in year so was it ordained by all on the day when he created the heavens and the earth of them four are sacred the st the th the th and the th months of the isl mic calendar that is the right religion so wrong not yourselves therein and fight against the mushrik polytheists pagans idolaters disbelievers in the oneness of all collectively as they fight against you collectively but know that all is with those who are al-muttaq the pious see the postponing of sacred month is indeed an addition to disbelief thereby the disbelievers are led astray for they make it lawful one year and forbid it another year in order to adjust the number of months forbidden by all and make such forbidden ones lawful the evil of their deeds seems pleasing to them and all guides not the people who disbelieve you who believe what is the matter with you that when you are asked to march forth in the cause of all jih you cling heavily to the earth are you pleased with the life of this world rather than the hereafter but little is the enjoyment of the life of this world as compared with the hereafter if you march not forth he will punish you with painful torment and will replace you by another people and you cannot harm him at all and all is able to do all things	0

nearly people have now signed petition to this effect calling on mayor sadiq khan to declare london independent and apply to join the eu london is an international city and we want to remain at the heart of europe let face it the rest of the country disagrees so rather than passive aggressively vote against each other at every election let make the divorce official and move in with our friends on the continent well can only see two ways of carrying out their suggestions find some country in europe which is willing to give up about square miles of its territory so that some haulage and removals companies can physically uproot the whole of london people buildings land the lot and move them to their new location think even pickfords eddie stobart and ryanair might struggle with that lot or leave london where it is but surrounded by border fence such as the hungarians have built patrolled by armed guards and no movement in or out of london without passport and visa issued by the home office they haven quite got grasp on joined up thinking have they as for the depth of their commitment to the cause protestor and photographer peter marshall said after rally in altab ali park whitechapel well over thousand protesters set off on long march to the offices of news international so out of people who signed the petition well over thousand marched to support it and wonder what the cops assessment of the total numbers was but maybe they were put off by the thought of that long march all the way from whitechapel high street to the shard for pity sake after all if you re bone idle good for nothing layabout miles is hell of long way innit run london as strike sovereign state strike member state protectorate colony of the eu that shower couldn run shower	0

words cannot describe the horror felt as delved into the truth of the eu we have been hoodwinked into the eu by deceitful disingenuous intentionally devious means the populace of the uk was never intended to find out the truth behind the eu until they reckoned it was too late truth is it is almost is too late we already are in the uk all but federal state in the united states of europe you never quite realised that did you they deliberately created political elite who knew full well that power was being ceded systematically treaty by treaty to the eu but were we the uk populace ever informed absolutely not why they made mega millions from eu scammery we the minions were shafted day daily monthly yearly forever where did your pensions go where did your schools your nhs your housing your social services go well million per day every day every week every month every year that is why uk is bankrupted for generations to come with trillion pound debt every word read about the eu leads me to the inescapable conclusion that the eu is an utterly corrupt profligate political monstrosity which has destroyed british jobs and bankrupted the uk for generations to come the eu operates on lobbying which is the technical term for bribery and corruption whatever cameron says eu law has supremacy over our uk law unless there is treaty change he may say so but the truth is that other countries will never agree this side of eternity to change the treaties so what is the connection between the eu the bilderberg group and the almost completed ttip transatlantic trade and investment partnership the bilderberg group meet in secret each year and they are group of phenomenally wealthy men and women from the worlds of big business banking and politics coming from across europe and the us the ttip represents an integral component of bilderberg attempt to rescue the unipolar world new world order by creating world company initially free trade area which would connect the united states with europe just as the european union started as mere free trade area and was eventually transformed into political federation which controls upwards of per cent of its member states laws and regulations with total contempt for national sovereignty and democracy ttip is designed to accomplish the same goal only on bigger scale the treaty is likely to advantage the corporations of both the us and the eu while disadvantaging their people it presents danger to democracy and public protection throughout the trading area the bilderberg group are focussing on how to derail global political awakening that threatens to hinder bilderberg long standing agenda to centralize power into one world political federation goal set to be advanced with the passage of the transatlantic trade and investment partnership ttip bilderberg globalists are aghast and there is panic in the ranks that their planned eu superstate is being eroded as result of populist resistance all around europe mainly centred around animosity towards uncontrolled immigration policies and just who might we expect to find at such secret gathering angela merkel herman van rompuy ex president of eu council jean claude juncker present president of the eu commission martin schultz present president of eu parliament david cameron george osbourne tony blair ed balls rona fairhead chair of the bbc trust michael leary of ryanair stuart rose ex and bse chairman bill clinton barak obama and many more what do they all have in common they are all trying to persuade you to stay in the eu why because it is in their warped self interest to do so is any of this in your interests absolutely not their modus operandi is that truth becomes lies and lies become truth sound familiar no possible option available other than to get out of eu asap vote leave	0

of various nationalities it is likely that he was one-quarter russian one-quarter german one-quarter jewish and at least one-quarter kalmuck mongol which accounts for his mongol appearance various authorities allege that his wife nadezhda krupskaya was jewess and that her family spoke yiddish in the home report sent to the british government in by mr oudendyke the dutch consul in st petersburg said that bolshevism is organised and worked by jews the report was included in pamphlet published as government white paper in april entitled russia no collection of reports on bolshevism in russia however the pamphlet was quickly withdrawn and reissued with various excisions and alterations made in the war records division of the united states national archives there is filed report from an american intelligence operative in st petersburg under record group records of the american expeditionary forces capt montgomery schuyler intelligence wrote the bolshevik movement is and has been since its beginning guided and controlled by russian jews of the greasiest type also in the national archives are two telegrams sent by american diplomats in russia state department document sent on may by consul summers in moscow relates jews predominant in local soviet government anti-jewish feeling growing among population document from consul caldwell in vladivostock on july describes fifty per cent of soviet government in each town consists of jews of worst type in january lenin died from causes variously described as heart attack brain hemorrhage and syphilis his comrades immediately began fighting amongst themselves to see who was to become his successor relative outsider joseph stalin came to the fore and purged all competition either by exiling or executing them since stalin was not jewish yet nearly all his opponents were it is often suggested that stalin was anti-semitic this is far from the truth stalin had three wives all of them jewesses the first was ekaterina svanidze who bore him one son jacob his second wife was kadya allevijah she bore him son vassili and daughter svetlana his second wife died in mysterious circumstances either by committing suicide or murdered by stalin his third wife was rosa kaganovich the sister of lazar kaganovich the head of soviet industry stalin daughter who in fled to the usa then married lazar son mihail her step-mother nephew svetlana stalin had total of four husbands three of them jewish stalin vice-president molotov was also married to jewess whose brother sam karp runs an export business in connecticut just to complicate things even more the molotov half-jewish daughter also called svetlana was engaged to be married to stalin son vassili after the death of stalin his successors kept up the tradition for report in the nai rith messenger relates to show that russia treats its jews well soviet premier nikita kruschev this week remarked at reception at the polish embassy that not only he himself and soviet president klementi voroshilov but also half the members of the praesidium have jewish wives mr kruschev made this remark to israeli ambassador joseph avidar who was amongst the guests kruschev wife was yet another kaganovitch according to report in the canadian jewish news of november the present soviet boss leonid brezhnev is married to jewess and his children are brought up as jews there are number of prominent jews in the soviet government including dimitri dymshits in charge of industry lev shapiro regional secretary of birobidjan and yuri andropov in charge of the secret police the kgb in fact every secret police chief in soviet history has been jew from the first uritsky to the most recent the murderous beria jew is also in charge of the soviet economy leonid kantorovich it is well-known fact that the bolsheviks were and are financed by jewish interests in the west at bolshevik celebration rally in new york carnegie hall on the night of march telegram of support from jacob schiff of kuhn loeb co was read out the telegram was reprinted in the next morning new york times schiff later tried to deny his involvement but thirty years later his grandson john admitted in the new york journal-american february that the old man had sunk twenty million dollars into the bolshevik cause another western bankers who poured funds into bolshevik russia was olaf ashberg of the stockholm nia banken he remained the soviets paymaster until the late the london evening standard of september reported visit by ashberg to switzerland for secret meetings with swiss government officials and banking executives diplomatic circles describe mr ashberg as the soviet banker who advanced large sums to lenin and trotsky in at the time of the revolution mr ashberg gave trotsky money to form and equip the first unit of the red army the bolsheviks also received assistance from armand hammer who still commutes back and forward between new york and moscow to take care of his business interests in both communities hammer occidental oil company is at the moment building mile chemicals pipeline in southern russia he is also on such good terms with the soviets that he personally arranges for soviet art galleries to lend paintings to america another american-based businessman to help out the soviet economy is michael fribourg who owns the massive continental grain company together with the louis dreyfus corporation these jewish speculators were able to buy up vast quantities of cheap american grain in sell it to the soviets at vast profit and collect an export subsidy from the taxpayer in every other east european country it is exactly the same story in hungary communist revolution was staged in instigated by the jew bela kun cohen during the three month regime the country was turned upside down in reign of murder and terror here again the government was composed almost entirely of jews and it was this factor which brought about the regime downfall as the ordinary hungarians detested jewish dictatorship kun was deposed and fled to the soviet union where he became chief of the secret police the cheka in southern russia it was not until that the jews were able to regain control three russian jews were installed as the ruling triumvirate matyas rakosi rosencranz erno gero singer and zoltan vas both rakosi and gero had been members of kun bloody government in germany the jews also tried to take over there in the chaos that followed the first world war aided by funds from the soviet ambassador joffe rosa luxemburg spartacus bund attempted to overthrow the government the revolt was quelled and its leaders luxemburg and karl liebknecht executed the post-war dictator of roumania anna pauker was the daughter of bucharest kosher butcher for time she earned her living teaching hebrew her father and brother now live in israel although tito was the only non-jewish dictator behind the iron curtain in the late he was tutored by the jew mosa pijade according to john gunther in behind the iron curtain he is tito mentor whatever ideological structure tito may have he got it from the shrewd old man moscow puppet government in czechoslovakia in the late was run by another jew rudolph slansky in poland too jews occupied virtually every position of authority in the post-war communist regime prominent among these were minc skryesewski modzelewski and berman jacob berman gradually eclipsed the others until he became supreme dictator by himself also gomulka wife was jewess even in china soviet jews were at work helping mao tse tung

this is different america from when cast my first presidential vote for barry goldwater and we learned at pm coast time that johnson had won in landslide now they at least wait until the polls close on the coast we have president now who appears to think he is still at the faculty lounge in cambridge ma debating the issues of the day with bunch of other liberals and is the smartest person in the room he has not listened to much advice from others who have different points of view on any issue as he knows best he has never had job before as an administrator has no idea how to get along with the congress and has been an absolute disaster with foregin affairs by any standard the list of negatives is long and well know to most readers of these boards as well as to those americans who pay attention to the real news the electorate has never been more dumbed down or less interested in the real news facts in my view the most potentially well informed people who ever lived on the planet have elected not to avail themselves of the multiple news sources from around the world and the average under thirty get news from the liberal media in tweets so maybe guy like scott walker is what we need now with serious record of achievement and leadership in an industrial state jeb bush and hillary are yesterday news even the younger people who never paid much attention now sense something is wrong about the clintons many many severe problems are festering in this country not the least of which is diminishing middle class terribly educated kids whose parent simply are not making it in the st century and no hope or way out that they see either near or long term manufacturing jobs are now moving at an exponential rate both out of the country and towards higher automation robots and systems designed to reduce the labor content retail is ruined with virtually everyone working part time with minimal to no benefits what we need is lemonade stands course at every elementary school to kindle again the idea of owning your own business and getting out there with innovative new ideas the business of america was always business from the farm to main street to the factory to the banks and everything in between when you take hope and possibilities out of the equation for younger people you just accelerate the downward spiral that is where we are today we do not have leader only theorist who knows better some of this is because we sent all the women to work in the and let the kids be brought up by non english speaking day care providers and did next to nothing to face the challenges of two working parents and now huge numbers of single working mothers who have no possibility to make ends meet without some help everything is just too expensive today for too many to just survive on their own with just the basics just ask any grade school teacher what the reality is in too many classrooms lice terrible behavior coping drugs starving kids and worse and it all starts at home robert frost defined that as the place that when you get there they have to take you in and for some these days home is mom car talk to some teachers you won believe how bad it is out there for far too many but my line has always been it just exposes the failure of men in this current society to step up to the plate and accept responsibility for their families and actions and you won ever see that point of view in the press but look around you and open your eyes the usa will spend trillion dollars in the next ten years on what some think are million illegal immigrants giving them free food free housing free medical care it illegal for any hospital to not treat ayone who shows up in the er free college educations in some states et al clearly some of we the legal citizens are much worse off than these illegals who flooded the borders were not stopped or even questioned blacks in inner cities are ready to burn them again as happened in when king was shot we are spending more money on the illegals rather than on solving needs of we the legal citizens inner cities infrastructure such as train bridges and higways child care and development et al our national priorities are all wrong in my view lament the fact that perhaps future political leaders and people all over america may never had read the great books won know what the words call me ishmael refer to or have vocabulary using words like indefatigable congeries or peripatetic but maybe that is not what we need right now in the early st century what we need is the leadership to get us back to those ideals and higher thoughts again hopefully later in the st century so as country we better roll up our sleeves and follow real leader if we want to move it or lose it	0

actually you did not deal with my points its not about being competitive with foreign nations we are getting little these days from us interantional corps selling to foreign nations the profits do not come here the first goal is not to be competitive with foreign nations but to have our economic community benefit us rather than our multinational corps and foregin nations our consumption engine built asia this was engineered by internaitonal corps to create larger consumption market for them the tpp protects them against us and other nations the tpp is multinational corporate protection act your blurb is fraught with innacuracy and free market propaganda competitiveness has nothing to do with low wages or free trade it about having the right products most of the products are simply our products manufactured with cheaper labor and cheaper factories who dont observe our labor and our environmental practices to protect us your solution is likely to get rid of those practices and drop our salaries to meet theirs there is no need to do this so billionaires and corps can get riches and we have more on welfare we need to get the tariffs back on as these show the real price of the products in job loss welfare and unemployment some of your blurb is out right dishonest such as the currency subsidies which have gone on for decades and about jobs leaving before the various free trade agreements we have seen the results of this swindle whereby the corporatists bought our representatives and had them tell us things would be better they lied there is no wealth created outside of the purchasing power of our economic community which we must take back control of from the corporations and billionaires according to your approach all the robots will be owned by producing corps and billionaires and they will dole out to the rest pur minimum guaranteed income welfare this is the result of putting our consumption engine into the hands of the greedy america first am not frustrated but am angry and my view is that those who colluded in these swindles and those of our representatives who have been bought should have all their assets confiscated as ill gotten gains from crimes and they should be sent to guantanamo as financial terrorists the only reason to allow foreigners to take our jobs and sell our products back to us was to enrich the corps who kept the gains outside the us they built their factories in asia with our consumption whose benefits should have accrued to us the fruits of our consumption belong to us china was nowhere before we and europe allowed them our trade we got no benefit for this the low prices were red herring obscuring the real costs which were paid by us and not the corps who made the profits from selling to us and kept them abroad	0

to me the changes the party makes aren about being right or wrong it about what is actually good idea in the long run and based on the list you gave of changes those feel like basically all the things sanders people feel would have given him an advantage in the primaries not made them more fair for example ending closed primaries this seems like an obvious one bernie benefitted from people who aren democrats having say in what democrats do but if you are democrat how do you think that feels don want people who aren on my team deciding what my team does like how is that ok party primaries are party primaries for reason bernie didn wanna run as an independent and that the price he has to pay you have to be willing to play by another party rules not expect the rules to change to favor you same with caucuses obviously that change is being demanded becaude bernie won more caucuses these don all seem like fair changes they seem like changes meant to favor outsiders they seem like changes meant to eventually change the whole party in bernie image	0

it was and is well documented that the uprising against qaddafi was orchestrated and led largely of jihadist forces it embarrassing how many of our leaders allowed their islamophilia to overwhelm commonsense making them complicit in destabilizing north africa and the middle east	0
edit if you have trouble with the word reaganist then it just trumpism but ago the ideology and terminal corruption is absolutely identical and trump is pretty much just reagan with another name including with the personality cult stolen billions mob ties media control attempts and welfare dismantlement constant propaganda lies and his uh memory troubles	0
no they obviously don merrick garland may be the best nominee the republicans could have hoped for but he certainly isn right-leaning reaganist it good nomination and it proves just how unreasonable the republican congress is	0
ya well the cold war reaganist conservatism with the republicans and neoconservatism with the democrats happened here some good news though the cold war is over communism lost it is no longer an effective system of governance now we just have to figure out how to regulate properly the part of our government that is capitalist and not the other way around for example how the federal reserve in the us is regulated by corporations and big banks not vice versa if alexander hamilton were alive today he would be ashamed to call himself an american	0
am actually looking forward to what the post-trump republican party will be republicans will undoubtedly parrot his positions of nationalism without the same bigotry and blatant incompetence in applying them it is at least my opinion better future for republicans than the reaganist who are just horrible	0
are you talking about vietnam think you re talking about vietnam that ridiculous the war in vietnam neither started nor ended under democratic leadership and everything in between was always fucked if the goddamn vietnam war is your barometer for the democratic party then sorry but you desperately need to reevaluate your politics five grandchildren in their all doing well is damn good sign of reaganist and by the way millennials are only barely in their thirties by now think it sounds like you re out of touch millennials are just now coming into adulthood and are being abused by conservative feed-the-fat-cat policies that boomers put in place and gen simply didn change in the and	0
the conservative reaganist hold over this country didn develop overnight it didn even really develop during reagan presidency hell democrats controlled at least one house of congress for the entirety of reagan presidency reagan himself would be super moderate by today gop standards these things build over generations obama looks incredibly moderate compared to bernie sanders but guarantee you that his biggest legacy won be obamacare or any other piece of legislation it ll be heralding in and inaugurating the next great ideological shift in american politics just like fdr and reagan did in the th century	0
well guess what the reaganist republicans made it that way when the ussr broke up	0
so guess when you are trump or reaganist and owe that much money to the maffya it makes sense to abolish retirement in the us and re use the accounts with the ss money to refund the russians simply take papy pension and hospitals and mortgages and education away and tell them to just strap their boots or somethin and start wiring their cash to moscow just call it tax cut plan and give his cut to the koch and mercer and adelson amp co and they ll stay happy with it	0
reckon that the current rhetoric of the gop really began to come into its full form out of reagan southern strategy and then today gop is just broken mirror reflecting distorted beams of reaganist economics and christian family values	0
in fact is is specifically the reaganist movement	0
mean not sure what people were expecting from the republican party when they put up some of the worst candidates out there donald trump was created out years of shit running candidates choose between an ultra-religious shitbag an unexperienced clueless buffoon reaganist who reads from script jeb and then there kasich he okay donald trump didn defeat political party he came in and won from perhaps the most clueless republican party in recent history and party after all that happened with gwb they still couldn steer away from ultra-religious neo-conservative politics that turns people away	0
the problem however is that you can just whip up booming economy things are slowing down everywhere europe is suffering from the same issues and china is undercutting everyone as hard as possible the focus of the economy needs to change and trump doesn have any kind of cohesive plan for that as far as know even if he did the gop is still committed to their reaganist trickle-down economic policies and will push for that in congress and we ve all seen how that worked out	0
there are real issues in rural communities that have nothing to do with god and country it not just about jobs but providing an alternative viewpoint that directly counters and undermines the gop years of southern strategy reaganist pep rallies there are other problems as well food deserts crime drug abuse esp meth unemployment yes that valid issue lack of medical care and support on and on and on we can tackle those issues and provide support but the real problems are activist apathy condescension regarding those areas lack of local state support from liberal areas and people getting burnt out because they don get enough support from higher ups on top of not realizing that they re combating years of down top political agendas and organizational support by the gop they support and groom micro-elections pta city councils etc they have coffee get togethers and volunteer nights where women come in with their knitting while they do mailings and callings and it doesn matter if it chicago or cowley county kansas	0
the reason lindsey graham sounds so different than lindsey graham is that before trump was elected the gop politicians still firmly believed that the majority of card-carrying republicans were suburban upper-income professionals who were committed to free trade and reaganist domestic foreign policies sure you occasionally sound some dog whistles to the lower educated portions of the base but they believed that this wasn the real backbone of the party so you have to be respectable	0
edit and of course using their usual full blown big brother double speech they tried to add subsection full of actual double speak not single word is valid in it original meaning to prevent immigrants including all legal ones and their childrens from receiving healthcare using the falsely nammed personal responsibility and work opportunity act which was once junta-era reaganist edict banning jews immigrants amp their childrens from trying to receive welfare benefits for which they paid taxes at doubled rate toward allow me to twist that shit bit would you and even if you don	0
gt and it time to put that reaganist monster back in the closet	0
except libertarianism is what corporations want the difference is they re represented by reaganist and the religious conservative branches of the gop the gop is joke and so is the libertarians just because they dont care for religion and foreign policy it doesnt make them better yet even after all that gary johnson still has my respect for not catering to the anarcho-capitalistic crowd but instead hes catering to everybody and pushing himself forward what hes doing now is what ron paul should of done instead of following an outdated economic system and abusing the gwb disaster	0
think if the democrats can properly show these people how third way reaganist neoliberal policies have hurt everybody but the they ll win the states	0
big small government doesn really fit either party anymore the evangelical faction within the republican party wants the government as big as possible so they can control everyone lives the majority of the republicans or the reaganist faction as like to call them don really care about the size of the government they just want it to serve the ultra rich and big business then there is the tea party that doesn want government at all yes we americans have anarchists in our government the democrats are also split into two factions the progressives like bernie sanders and the mainstream democrats aka liberals like president obama and hilary clinton	0
well just going to state that is one of the old guard reaganist republicans	0
conservatives have truly been indoctrinated by cold war red scare propaganda and it time to put that reaganist monster back in the closet so we can have real progress	0
not taking into account the rest of the political spectrum when making these statements get us into trouble believe that the demonization of the extreme left of the political spectrum socialism and communism in this country through things like the red scare and reaganist economic policies and myths welfare queens anyone are part of the reason that the overton window has shifted so far right in this country	0
what happened is that this individualism became toxic when it switched from youthful self-expression to the reaganist agenda basically the impulses are the same but the tie-dye was switched out for suits	0

no berniecrats are not the base this is frankly an obvious observation and something of stupid demarcation to even make who is the base you could segregate the democratic voting bloc perhaps dozen different ways but that isn what we re supposed to be about they aren the base but nor are they something entirely separate from the base articles like this serve no more productive purpose than do the obstinate bernie supporters that are more concerned about their ideological purity than their country we need to come together because we have bigger fatter uglier trumpier fish to fry	0

just want to get clinton supporters to say am fat shaming and maybe the clinton campaign will take that up as an issue when trump called rosie donnell fat pig the clinton types in the media say that is an attack on all women so perhaps they can claim that calling clinton fat which she is is an attack on all fat people the clinton side claims that when trump says stupid stuff like that it only makes more women support clinton so will they play the fat shaming card or is that for the next election fat acceptance is legitimate issue to some time clintionette to come out of the closet identity politics is the democratic establishments only core value lately but you are right person personal appearance should be irrelevant and if they are supporting what support would ignore what they look like just chewing the fat here and giving the clinton correct the record workers something easy to respond to	0

do you really think that verizn paid her bribe to go and show support for verizon striking workers do you think walmart likes that she has voted yes every time the minimum wage was increased and is again advocating it be raised are you really being an innocent bystander when you use terms such as killery clintionette in an attempt to be funny	0
no bribes clinton gave speech to the bosses at verizon and was paid for an hours work verizon then gave to the clinton foundation to help with children medical care meanwhile verizon eliminated workers health care on may taking thousands of children health care away verizon said they couldn afford the medical expense they needed the children health care money to give to clinton so she can help children now verizon is simply raising the health care costs of their workers and their children but the verizon boss gave the legal maximum to the clinton campaign is this the kind of thing that clinton was hiding on her home brew server we may never know clintionette let them eat fake	0
yet just about everyone knows that clinton is lying when she claims she has changed from support to opposition to the tpp so finding japanese person who simply speaks the truth is worth listening to clintionette let them eat fake	0
when companies give money to the clinton foundation they won be criticized by clinton the charity gets money from dictators and capitalists all over the world they just want to help hillary do good clinton went to the verizon strike picket lines to ask for workers votes and labor union endorsements but she did not tell those workers that she works for verizon too clinton got from verizon to give speech to the bosses verizon also gave to the clinton foundation to help children get health care meanwhile verizon cut off thousands of children health insurance may because their parents dared to call strike so if disney gave money to the clinton foundation they are safe from clinton criticism clintionette let them eat fake	0

office ruining his career who was found to do nothing wrong but was then audited by the irs for three years after billy dale and his family went through hell thanks to the clintons attorney general janet reno the fbi and the irs irvine wrote hillary greatest crime was not perjury it was trying to send an innocent man to prison to justify having fired him and his staff without cause memorandum by former presidential aide depicts hillary rodham clinton as the central figure in the travel office dismissals politically damaging episode that the aide said had resulted from climate of fear in which officials did not dare question mrs clinton wishes wrote the nyt in whitewater scandal hillary and her husband were partners in shady real estate development firm called whitewater development corp in

as political adversaries cattle-futures miracle hillary first commodity trade was in cattle futures where she ordered futures contracts which normally cost dollars with only dollars in her account this turned into dollars by the next morning and after months totaled with trading help from james blair blair who at the time was outside counsel to tyson foods inc arkansas largest employer says he was advising clinton out of friendship not to seek political gain reports the washingtonpost robert red bone ran the springdale ak financial services company refco allowed the trades and later after investigation had to pay the largest fine at the time in the exchanges history and was suspended for three years hillary clinton said she was able to make the successful trading because she read the wall street journal for research lootergate bill and especially hillary started to ship white house furniture to their personal home in chappaqua the clintons claimed they were donated but at only some were proven to be donated and meant to stay in the white house after contacting the manufacturers the clintons returned some of the furniture after pressure was put on them to do so gop lawmakers and others criticized hillary rodham clinton in particular for accepting many presents just before she joined the senate and became covered by strict ethics rules that prohibit accepting gifts worth

you really don see difference between utilizing dumbness and exploiting mental retardation shamelessly good example of what talking about is the stooges for the former and the recently released john lennon retardation mockery footage for the latter it seems to most of us that ill ferrell was going to exploit the latter lloyd christmas and his buddy were most definitely not mentally retarded they lived on their own had jobs traveled across country on their own and even got blind kid to buy decapitated bird and let not forget he got the best of sea bass by getting him to pick up their tab no way could mentally retarded person pull those off but his stupidity was necessary for some of the other hijinx which transpired my point with michael fox was to point out that hollywood would never make fun of their own as he suffers terribly through dread progressively-debilitating disease disease much like alzheimer in that respect no one for one moment would think that making fun of someone spilling soup all over oneself would be funny turns out however that right about this and you re wrong not shockingly will ferrell has seen the light and has backed out of the project maybe you ll listen to me next time but probably not	0

am not supporting either candidate funny that you labeled me liberal on other forums when speak about the nd amendment get labeled as republithug	1
be very happy if the moderation team considered gun nuts slur and not civil the way they prohibit slurs such as libtard and republithug it an ad hominem attack crafted to portray gun owners as slobbering fetishists it as stupid and wrong as any other fallacious attack which is all the slur is an attack that instantly derails civil and rational discussions about gun violence	1
same thing why we call liberals liberals and it pisses them off they hate mean hate labels unless they are the ones using them idiocrat hypocrites	1
thanks for confirming that you are flavor of the day type the more you yak the more you expose yourself as an idiocrat	1
sure this has been said lot but it bears repeating regressive dimocrats have lost over political seats since obama was elected in us house us senate state governorship and state legislature seats gone to republicans and the idiocrat party says the gop is finished sure we ve got the gope problem like ryan shining obama shoes but that not the bigger picture the bigger picture is that conservatives still outnumber liberals in states	1
you should ask him but know that would be too hard for an idiocrat	1
muslim isn race idiocrat	1
by making up rights gotcha here let me stamp your idiocrat card for you sure sooner or later you ll get free lunch	1
his step is preventing gun ownership of anyone who cannot manage their social security benefits they deem said person as not fit to own guns and the idiocrat liberals say that bozo doesn want to take away anyone guns	1
again why would they care anyone with half freakin brain already knows that he and the rest of those who can make lot of money and use every trick in the book to minimize their tax bill what do you expect to find that is going to be some earth-shattering scandal this country truly has become an idiocracy and you are an idiocrat	1

this is what happens when good men turn down the job am talking to you mr hairdoo anyways there is no other recourse but to vet the candidates ryan is not it might as well pick demturd	1
you gotta wade through lot of the libturd internet to get to the truth you look up stories about this and all you see is how this billion is not payout for the return of our hostages but reagan was it is incredible chrome is all libturd hits can even find true story about this bing was no better dozens of sites that cut and pasted the original op ed that has no factual basis the link posted is from the actual iran contra report after reading through it you will see that there is no comparison meanwhile would like to remind those that the contra who were fighting war against radical communist dictator and we re doing really well in nicaragua suddenly had the carpet pulled from under them by the demturd congress they left the contra high and dry at their greatest moment of need what ollie did per his superiors was skim funds from the sale of weapons to iran to give to these fighters who were trying to overthrow despot main point am making the media today is ruling the roost with revisionist history that is right out of	1
not anti semitic but jews overwhelmingly and stupidly support her and any demturd as well	1

what gem this guy is have to say he fits well into the demturd party	1
hey nice to see the demturd convention coming together in harmony lol gotta love it lmmfao	1
she too hot to be demturd	1
except being anti-establishment doesn automatically make one reaganesque reagan might ve initially been demturd but at least he stood firmly and didn lie to the public like obama does	1
and the other shoe drops this is the guy was worried about he has lot going for him his track record is he pretty much destroyed baltimore but unfortunately right now it is reaping lot more of what he sowed and he plays crappy guitar low information voters which is demturd prerequisite will flock to him like flies on shzt what is not going for him is that he is lilly white and still has winky although to garner more votes am sure he would willingly cut it off hillary is going to have to work for her crown the libturds were going to bestow on her	1
oooooops trouble be brewin on the demturd plantation	1
hey all this bs was pre-ordained by nbc and mslsd why should anyone be suprised there collective conduct provided proof that the msm is in bed with the demturd talking points and libturd agenda without question	1
the only way the democratic party is going to fight dirty enough to repel trumpublicanism is if progressives do an in-party political coup the dem establishment has proven to be complicit in the whole mess if you choose to believe they are this stupid you are naive look at how hard and how effectively they fight against the left and finger wagging is not going to force people to vote not if they do it not if do it not if anyone does it	1
it real threat rather than bluff they will back democrats if it serves them better than trumpublicanism	1
and that should be explicitly understood already nagging at people that weren motivated to vote for hillary and neoliberals is going to have the same impact going forward that it did in that of wet fart people that argue otherwise need to stop pretending like they want the best chance of curtailing trumpublicanism because any idiot with two eyes can see that strong left is what has base that can defeat trumpublicans	1
those people get expunged from the party lot of them already have with more to come the republicans that have stood up to trump in any meaningful degree were taken away the ones that slip through the cracks are already statistically irrelevant they cannot salvage that party and if they try they will only continue to keep this latent fascism on life support assuming it doesn take over instead in fact most of those dissidents agree with trump policies they just hate his lack of tact because it not popular they will rally behind the next clownbag that seems smarter than trump they deserve to be blamed for developing trumpublicanism the whole party because that reality their southern strategy and mass concerted demagoguery spawned president trump	1
but they don exist in the party anymore you folks across the river have been watching you know this conversion over to trumpublicanism really started with walker and the same full-force ownership of the state govt as what happened nationally years ago we knew this was all coming we knew we were testpiece but between the combination of our own inept state democratic party and the seemingly deaf national party no one heard	1
ve personally just now seen the cost updates for client who will be afftected by the tariffs its not good and its going to hit his solidly trump-voting workers in the wallet and thats after the company eating the difference as long as it can the owner hopes they wont last long think the best hope for killing trumpism is trump everything he touches dies we can only hope he kills trumpism trumpublicanism before he kills democracy	1
very very early in the game the game is long one and will take year at least to unfold one poll does not consensus make lindsey and all the others in bed with trumpublicanism are going to be shocked and surprised when the evidence of trumps crimes is so overwhelming its going to destroy the republican brand by the time this is all over the early polls dont write history the later ones do ask nixon	1
it didn because there wasn draft people were able to sit it out for the most part without it directly effecting them much bush also didn make much effort to roll back civil liberties rather just stalled progress trump and trumpublicanism are directly effecting people at home they are trying to roll things back and dismantle institutions that people support and rely on think that the difference that might result in younger progressives waking up and standing up	1
exactly people want to are trying to would like to hope to ban trump like michael savage islamicization of government and pc on steroids does england have the balls to leave the eu enjoy	0
the horde are great peril wherever true--but they have no substantive ground the caliphate whose ambition has always eyed the complete islamicization of the mediterranean lake has several jewels in its crown around the periphery each of them with its own special character cordoba morocco cairo damascus but culturally anatolia is the bridgehead and istanbul has always been the summit its strategic control on land and water is stranglehold over the passage from east to west and north and south and back again only hideous poverty has restrained it these past years its monuments are the ancient equivalent of paris and manhattan combined and make the oil powerhouse of arabia look culturally like texas here in ankara--look down from the failed national socialist ambitions of the ataturk monument to mosque whose scale is unparalleled anywhere--and which dates to sometime in the turkey is the spearhead of the islamic empire that is why it has begun to rear its head--erdogan current hubris floats on the tsunami of arabian petrobillions	0
the german government is inferring that protesters are like nazis when they are levying fines on free speech and attempting to crush resistance to islamicization someone needs to deal with frau merkel immediately	0
so you now know for sure this is all the setup awaiting the next step all part of the islamicization of western culture	0
for the past years at least the catholic church has been nothing but front-group for islamicization of the west	0
all for that but with the government the police the military the eu the schools the press and soros types all pushing islamicization the chances aren looking too good europe has about guns per people the us about three times as many many brits for example supported capitulating to hitler if he were attacking them today they would capitulate in short order	0
blockquote am not interested in providing cover for muslims or in passive appeasement but in protecting our own freedoms blockquote how will removal of any mosque or widespread publication of the scholarship that shows islam claims about its origins are completely false impinge on your liberty one little bit zero change in society is required you don have to lift one finger you won lose any liberties you will gain them the freedom to walk around without fear of being decapitated raped or ransomed by jihadis sorry more paranoid about liberty than you are and have to say your argument is complete nonsense you are just reacting non-sensibly because your position got called out rather than say hmm perhaps we can defeat islam and don have to resort to pathetic appeasement of it you come out with spurious nonsense that resisting islamicization will somehow cost other citizens their liberty call bs on this blockquote however banning muslims and islam in all forms would result in the removal of freedoms of non-muslims and would require an absolute change to our society and culture which am not willing to sacrifice blockquote how will banning islam limit the liberty of non-muslim citizens in any way it will not but it will increase the liberty of women to wear what they like homosexuals to walk freely in the streets jews to show their symbols ex-muslims to speak freely danish and french cartoonists to draw what they please without being massacred it sounds to me that you want to defend islam and you are making strawmen based on citizen rights to defend this evil blockquote it doesn matter what you or think the fact is that there will never be enough support for the approach you are taking and quite likely not enough even for my own wishes on the subject to be realised blockquote stop listening to the pro-islamicist media surveys such as the recent sky survey on the uk make it crystal clear what the citizens want but the elites and their media allies want something else the argument you have just made does not reflect the popular will at all it is really starting to sound like you will make any excuse to defend islam now	0
why are so sure only the nsa had dirt on merkel or that they are forcing merkel to do this remember merkel worked for the stasi and was certainly known if not controlled by vladimir putin it is more likely she was double agent in place of russia or of another power at best if your contention is correct that there is some dirt on merkel that only the nsa derived even then it wouldn be the nsa which blackmailed her into doing this but rather obama and his masters who used the intel derived against merkel the nsa simply doesn have the authority or ability to effect such an action let alone the type of people who would want to the nsa is ran by people who despise the islamicization of europe not celebrate it merkel on the other hand by her actions is traitor and an enemy of nato although supposed dissident and agent of western intelligence services in east germany during the cold war her actions subsequently are decidedly anti-western her outlook is decidedly european internationalist and her background is communist your hypothesis is intriguing but at best would point to intel being used by another traitor in the west namely obama rather than the nsa or official us policy look at people who want this to happen by their public statements the international obama soros leftists globalists or who derive leverage and power from the disruption it causes to germany and nato russia syria china israel putin	0
don know if you tried staying up for wikileaks did fell asleep halfway through alex jones spiel but dead tired and cranky hear what you are saying and have to agree there is no compatibility with islam and western values why they want to mix the two is beyond my comprehension considering what is going on in europe if they aren terrorizing if don get their way they sue they sue when they are offended remember several years ago when somalis came to columbus my mother calling me and telling me how they were turning workplaces upside down to accommodate their faith ve heard they weren friendly immigrants didn know the extent of their religion but feel it is something that can be trusted their women and gay rights record should stand on itself and we the taxpayers are paying for this as well as all the illegal immigrants we have all been brainwashed by pc that we can name someone who is an enemy to our nation ve got friend who tried correcting me about islam being religion of peace don judge whole by few terrorists seriously people thought christianity was bad this culture is completely against it and judaism in barbaric way this isn poltics it self-preservation it not islamaphobia it not an irrational fear there are plenty of reasons not to want this element so in those respects am against the islamicization of europe and the the government and the media is really trying to do psy-op on the nation saying what is good is bad and what is bad is good as for illegal immigration am person who believes in fairness and justice plus our over-population remember numbersusa had video immigration gumballs and that was just over the amount of legal immigrants we take in my kids are and don know what kind of opportunities they will have it was nice chatting with you hope you get some rest laughing at your user name ha and won get started with this gender fluidity business they are imposing on all the nations children via common core your boy might be learning about the gender purple unicorn come kindergarten you can tell me they are not trying to weaken our nation and further the depopulation agenda with trying to cause this confusion under the guise of more pc	0

well trump you were advised to tone down rhetoric on moslem immigration and you listened to it bad move then and you didn follow up on the rhetorical victory over demanding you denounce those who question obama islamicization another bad move as you can see this weakened your standing as nationalist conservative candidate those votes have obviously gone to carson who spoke forcibly against moslem immigration that statement you would love moslem in your cabinet cost you supporters you can still recover by focusing back on immigration restriction especially of moslems at the right opportunity re explain your moslem in cabinet potentiality as meaning you might consider someone who had been moslem is now christian or someone who is secular non observant secular moslem in short trump you lost standing among nationalist conservatives who have responded to carson neo-trump immigration restriction and trump like refusal to retreat from political correct demands sophistication in policy isn the same thing as being sophisticated politically correct in public remember this no moslem immigration no moslems in your cabinet death to moslem jihadis	0
step the us and any other sane western countries left in this world should abandon the un step kick turkey out of nato until it returns to it secular and democratic ways step rename nato and invite in some of our pacific allies that have not gone off the deep end with islamicization step tell european countries that if they don knock it off with the marxism they are out of the new nato as well step tell the remaining enemies of western style civilization to off and leave us alone and get back to us once they ve straightened their crap out or we ll make them leave us alone for good	0

right wingers best way to hide money from them is by putting it in science book right wingers if their brains were dynamite there wouldn be enough to blow their hats off right wingers they all think patriotism means wearing chickenshit made in taiwan flag pin on their made in china walmart flammable suit jackets they wouldn get clue of the true meaning of patriotism if they all stripped naked smeared themselves with clue musk chained themselves together and got down on all fours in field full of clues for an entire night right wingers best way to confuse them is to throw comment at them with no monosyllabic words right wingers they all believe the only good pow is one who comes home in body bag and if he dares come home alive his family must be threatened with death and if you re muslim soldier and die in battle your parents must be insulted by white trash asshat who got five deferrals right wingers think they know the meaning of the word hero but thought they could vote for presidential candidate who was born in panama and can take the oath of office got shot down on his very first mission over vietnam was nicknamed songbird by his pow-mates because he would sing like bird and say anything to get out of torture and then thought he could trade hanoi hilton points for nights in the wh right wingers claim they are against abortions but then oppose the one most effective tool against abortion birth control we re talking iq-of-a-rattle material here right wingers every last one of them starts spitting out their twisted fantasies of bestiality and coprophagia the minute you remind them of their homophobia give them ten minutes there are too many syllables in that sentence they may blow that fuse in their recalled k-mart brains right wingers claim they are not freeloaders but statistics clearly show the vast majority of freeloaders on food stamps and welfare are white trash just like them right wingers claim the illegal aliens are stealing their jobs but when the leader of the itinerant agricultural workers told them there were jobs in the industry come and take them not one of the lazy white trash showed up when was the last time you saw lazy white boi nailing shingles in texas after hailstorm lol right wingers what the only way to improve their iq get them smart phone with autocorrect instead of making it worse it makes their writing better lmao right wingers still mad superior black man made their gonads retract for eight years by smackdowning not one but two of their haircut white trash grey-skinned useless loser candidates right wingers screaming like little girls that they are becoming the absolute minority in this country because they can no longer screw without the help of chemicals lol right wingers so pathetic that polls show the only person they think can beat hillary has already lost twice lol right wingers claim white trash are freeloading off welfare and food stamps because of liberal policies but are too st pid to realize that when they say that they are confirming that white trash is exactly the opposite of illegal immigrants when immigrants are given choice to work or freeload they always work when white trash are given choice to freeload or work they choose freeloading right wingers the difference between their white trash and immigrants is that white trash want all the benefits as handouts while immigrants come here ready to work and pay taxes for the benefits such as education and health care the only reason they don is because braindead right wing chumps don want them to and their braindead legislators then block them from doing so the problem is not them the problem is the right wing chumps right wingers they put little wheels on their trash trailer homes because it makes them think their life is going somewhere right wingers they are such ignorant morons that one of their state senator fools from kentucky brandon smith recently stated in public hearing won get into the debate about climate change but ll simply point out that think in academia we all agree that the temperature on mars is exactly as it is here nobody will dispute that yet there are no coal mines on mars there no factories on mars that aware of lmao the average temperature on mars is degrees below zero on the farenheit scale lmao right wingers claimed printing money would increase inflation inflation is at historic low of right wingers said the stimulus would not work economists agree it saved million jobs right wingers claim obama is increasing the deficit the deficit has fallen by more than right wingers claimed obamacare would cause insurance premiums to rise kaiser study predicts decrease in in major cities right wingers still make farm animal noises about benghazi being scandal investigation no wrongdoing by obama administration right wingers whined about the irs targeting conservatives investigation liberal groups also targeted right wingers the only good ones are either

right wingers	0

your semantics at play will not win the day here the fact is the cruz momentum is over trump not only has second wind going into the convention he will have tidal wave starting with new york and following with the rest of the north eastern united states katich is far distant second and cruz is way in the distance from kasich the polls for trump are in excess of ahead so kasich is looking for vp will he look to cruz or wi to trump the answer is obvious trump has already telegraphed long ago he needs an inside government man cruz needs no one as he has demonstrated in his limited months as first time jr senator from texas delegates uncommitted or if you wish unbound will gravitate to the power the winner the fellow who can whisk them down to mir lago for long weekend where the family to can have whatever they wish all the golf tennis luxury and authentic gold gilt including the finest trump steaks trump wine or trump water for those teetotalers understand cheatau trump is very nice lol face it what can cruz offer trump may be gilt but cruz is polyester and that billy sunday act is wearing on the ears all most as the clinton laugh and shrill cruz has performed poorly in the defamation of trump and he has never stopped trying once he began but lyin ted does work because the average american sees cruz has sticky hands and his crew is un-trust worthy take the enquirer it probably not true but might be who can say this thursday but this we can be sure of it began with marco rubio operatives and cruz knows it yet attempts to make it trump sin and that is just one of cruz trust issues cruz wants the evangelical but they run from him like the devil incarnate think know why he may be brilliant but he is not the person he wishes you to think he is and trump comes across as just another guy here what is behind trump bigger then life appeal his followers are not so much in fawning awe of him they believe under the right circumstances that they can be him perhaps not literally but in their own way they see trump is comfortable being trump and the quote by steinbeck here is not so much about socialism but more about the american psyche and that is what drives trumpers socialism never took root in america because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires john steinbeck	0
agree and soon as the donald is sworn in as president he nominates cruz to the supreme court then names katich as his new vp	0
kasich panders to the criminal invaders from mea-he-co and south america he should pander to the tea party and working americans who are paying for all of the government cash and services provided to the invaders katich is rino will never vote for him now that he is in support of the invader enemies of america	0
never said ted cruz wrote any article at red state hence the question mark was questioning you associating nevertrump with cruz vast majority of never trumpers are or were cruz supporters ve never heard that from anyone but trump supporters donald trump may have been an extremely weak nominee as you say but ted cruz and his supporters couldn even beat trump because everyone was against him the fact that he did as well as he did with the media on trump side is credit not detriment like it or not the perception across the whole of america is that ted cruz and many of his voters were stealing delegates after trump won state because the media helped spread trump lie that cruz was stealing delegates it that simple trump lies you re more than welcome to try to come up single lie lyin ted actually said you be the first trump supporter ever to come up with one actually believe that the bush family and the gop establishment used cruz to stop trump again because trump lied about that and the media repeated it katich staying in until the end was proof that trump was preferable over cruz many voters will be as loyal to cruz and his supporters as they have been to the republican nominee we aren being loyal to cruz we are refusing to vote for liberal gop nominee for the third election in row four years from now no matter how upset may be will still vote for the gop nominee even if it is cruz because that is the best way to defeat the democrats no it isn you mentioned earlier that you learned more about politics this election than you had known before that seems to be common trait among trump supporters the simplest way to explain it is that it isn about democrats and republicans it about liberal and conservative it about what will happen when they get in office and who will take the blame republicans control congress but obama has gotten of the bills he wants passed with no challenge no matter whether it trump or hillary spending will increase obamacare will stay and liberal judges will be appointed bad things will happen far better for the democrats to take the blame used to think like you do twenty years ago when first started getting into politics there lot more to learn	0
would it not be funny if carson came in rd with katich in nd cruz th what would they do then that is what want to see	0
national review when ted cruz rubio and katich have the opportunity to stand in unity against the leftist mob instead they chose to align with and defend the bernie sanders supporters moveon and the chicago obama thugs does anyone really believe senator ted cruz rubio or katich would stand up to the mob to defend your assembly and free speech rights actions spear louder than words people	0
never let crisis go waste these clowns katich rubio and cruz are only blaming trump it is politically advantageous to do so wait until their rallies get broken up lol	0
problem is he is establishment too he brings no change for the people clinton or katich no big difference globalism still wins	0
katich does well with black voters in oh could bring few extra black votes to the gop carson is only other guy that has chance for this	0
cruz is squishy on how he handle the illegals already here he only announced wall after trump leader popularized the concept is it conservative to support open borders and amnesty bush rubio katich	0
nobody is giving katich any credit think he killed an imaginary bear and an isis terrorist with his incessant air karate chops	0
don understand why they let kasich slide probably because he was not considered threat to anyone well his policies were and are threat to me one is ethanol the other is manufacturer of implements claiming to be american made products this has proved to be false the warranty was useless katich appears happy to be the spoiler in this race for the nomination he is man of principle all right but it is democrat principles all told he won meet the thresholds of most states to gather delegates he can only hurt the efforts of senator cruz agree with you that the senator would be good pick for the supreme court however there may be political considerations should trump fall just short of delegates three states could easily put trump over the top new york new jersey and california of course they are at the tail end of the race	0
only cruz and katich left	0
no debate just katich and cruz what ever	0
one of katich biggest donors is george soros democrat	0
the only reason katich won ohio is because dem voters crossed over to vote for him yesterday by the thousands you think maybe they were trying to deny trump the win on the other hand with katich support of tpp his days to amnesty his open border policies his platform is indistinguishable from the democrats	0
john kasich is open borders big government et al you might as well be leftists because you support the same disastrous ideas you re the lying losers and cruz and kasich trump is not wimp he has successful businesses and meets his payroll katich is wimpy loser so vote kasich	0
rubio bush walker christie katich seriously is silver really this stupid does he really have such low opinion of america that he thinks one of these losers should or does have chance disgusting	0
probably happened don watch fox katich isn going to the rnc convention but is going to naacp conference instead think the smack talking is pretty well deserved	0
katich your minutes of fame is up we are on to you part of the establishment and trying to wriggle into broker convention as the nominee the stupidity of what has been washington is mind-boggling thank trump for exposing all on both sides of the party american people we need to come together regardless of political affiliation and go medieval on the lying elected establishment they continue to think they are still running the show trump	0
technically anyone can be nominated at the convention that whey there had been talk of ryan romney and others katich doesn need to stay in to be potentially but extremely unlikely to be nominated he in if for his minutes of fame	0
katich is not on the ballot in pennsylvania he did not get enough signatures	0
katich and florin have charisma	0
both trump and katich are libtards therefore their plans don involve the constitution or legitimate laws they involve ruling by executive fiat iow dictatorship theres nothing to know to implement their plans	0
yes if did not know katich daddy had government job too	0
you got that right jeb and katich are principled principally they want to keep our southern border wide open for millions of third world peasantry to flood our neighborhoods schools and welfare roles and they want muslims imported each and every year with permanent resident status so that americans can be more easily slaughtered that is after throwing them baby showers you know jeb and katich are acting out of love	0
well in the picture the fat lady is singing pray not he will never build wall he will get rid of social security like he said everything liberal is wonderful to him katich is liberal no doubt about it and also wants globalization yes person all for the money like the rest of the corruption in washington	0
kasich supporters could go to trump katich has had real accomplishments rubio is debater trump is doer in the free market much like kasich in government ohio is threatened by the export of manufacturing jobs and wage competition with immigrants the kasich support will not naturally flow to rubio but the establishment choices are getting slim bush supporters have been made to distrust rubio but any port in storm	0
john katich is the devil with declaration like that	0
katich seems to be coming down with foot-and-mouth disease	0
only thing worse then katich is cruz	0
katich can carry the mail much less win the nomination he loser he is also anti nd and too rinoish	0
one of katich donors is george soros	0
katich going for cabinet position in the clinton administration--or maybe nice cushy ambassadorship somewhere safe	0
no it isn why are you refusing to answer why you guys care so much about katich cruz and santorum endorsing trump	0
katich is the only one who can beat her in the head to head	0
hope so too polls indicate florida voters are looking past their former governor jeb and sitting senator rubio maybe ohio will do the same with kasich katich called himself the cincinnati kid understand cincinnati has recently become sanctuary city maybe ohio will vote against kasich	0
the republican national convention is now closing without major incident that great yet some conservatives were freaking out because gov katich didn use an executive order to ban open carry during convention week they painted scenarios of thugs armed to the teeth who would be triggered by the sight of an armed citizen yet we should be looking at principles instead the principle of our god-given right to bear arms shall not be infringed even if the government or fellow citizens thinks someone will act out or even if people are scared someone will act out yes something could have happened but it didn and even if there had been violence that wouldn have justified prohibiting people from carrying guns for protection from that violence	0
like katich rubio is only remaining in the race in the hopes that the gop will try to pull something dirty at the convention to thwart the will of the people	0
pay attention people katich is gonna be major problem for trump	0
cat it can still happen paul ryan maybe hoping that trump doesn get the delegates he needs going into the convention and the gope will pull the contested convention all of the remaining states need to vote for trump don trust any of the gope it just seems to easy for both cruz and katich to suddenly drop out of the race even though they should have done it sooner	0
waste of time he can work indiana all he wants if trump mops up the north east people ain gonna waste there votes on loser just ask katich after yesterday	0
trump now needs whereas prior to wisconsin he needed only of outstanding delegates you forgot that know that the trump beagles will arf-arf anything no matter how improbable or preposterous that they re told to but between feedings they need to come up to speed on this if trump does not have delegates by the time of the convention he will not get the nomination all cruz and his organization have to do is what conway describes them as doing more than sufficiently thus far to prevent the slug-like nitwit trump from getting to forget ny if trump fails to get of the vote he never come close to that then cruz and katich will get about delegates in chump home state in pennsylvania chumps can suck on their at present lead only delegates of are un-pledged to candidate on em any em ballot of the remaining pledged on the first ballot only more than half belong to the rnc hmm wonder who they ll vote for chump will be lucky to win dozen pa delegates also maryland is not good fit with the chump and cannot understand why chump halfwits consistently award all its delegates to orange girl	0
trump cares about trump after that we don now what we would get with president trump he is roll of the dice cruz is the thinking man trump cruz for president trump for lead contractor to build the wall hillary for leavenworth sanders for the dementia ward katich for nice-guy button he can wear on his lapel	0
katich is lib he just wearing the wrong jersey	0
carson is christian katich is communist big big difference	0
cruz son of preacher man lost katich son of mailman lost bush son of tch lost rubicon son of communist lost christy son of donut lost	0
in candidate votes del candidate illustration trump katich bush rubio cruz	0
katich doesn know how to get real	0
katich and walker so far no senators and if they support obama trade bills immigration and common core education hell no	0
katich should be democrat	0
katich was intolerable last night and wrong on so many points as out of place as jim webb in the dnc debate but the two stunners were saying he was the only active executive on the stage thereby underlining that trump is an actual executive and kasich government worker and when he claimed illegal immigrants should be able to stay if they were law abiding law abiding illegal immigrants think he said it more than once so if you are breaking the law by being here you should be allowed to keep breaking the law if you don break the law turn to the person to your right and say that with straight face you may have future in politics	0
katich and trump are almost siamese twins amiright	0
so you re starting to understand why trump doesn want donors it because he have to make public who supports him trump is the one meeting with priebus working with katich and lining up and establishment running mate	0
responded to earlier comments about the sleaze bag draft record so don fault me for bringing it up trump will sweep ny is an unbelievably stupid remark trump needs to sweep separate congressional districts cds to get all delegates you keep confusing overall primary polling with individual cd prospects they are not the same and of course you forgot few things of definite interest considering just new york city nyc alone there are so few republicans in every nyc cd excepting staten island that to gain majority in one of them which is all that one needs to win em three em delegates in each is far easier to accomplish than outside nyc for example in only em registered em republicans in the bronx voted in the republican primary because there are three cds wholly in bronx county all cruz needs to do is convince fewer than of them in each district to vote for him to reach majority that would net him nine delegates cruz has demonstrated time and again that his data on voters is extraordinarily fine-grained the republicans registered to vote in those cds could very well be cruz supporters contacted many months ago about voting trump cannot even get his own children to register failing that cruz and katich combined need only convince registered republicans not to vote for chump and the delegates in the cd will be awarded proportionally given cruz three delegates to trump six not good enough for trump to sweep his front porch much less the state of new york only registered republicans can vote on april th independents and dims chump fans for the most part would have had to have re-registered as republicans no later than em october em to vote in republican primary	0
asked what evidence you have that trump would rule by executive fiat and that he would not face congressional challenges and you gave one example of trump talking about liking someone yet you ignore all the indications trump provides in what he says and doesn say have you seen or heard trump say word about katich since the primaries no kasich is not somoene trump finds suitable to serve trump is not evaluating kasich on likability you say the only measure of another person worth which dt deploy seems rooted in narcissism not constitutional principles or ethics yet trump took down his opponents by hammering them on character and policy lying ted and crooked hillary are about character and policy he soundly criticized cruz for what his campaign did to dr ben carson an ethical issue support for veterans is policy decision not rooted in narcissism and this can be said for trump other policies like immigration and trade so don know what you ve been watching you say your only clues about how trump would conduct the presidency come from his reaction to the people with whom he was in competition yet trump reliance on advisors in many key areas shows that he recognizes the need for and accepts wise advice he readily admits that his expertise is mainly in business and he has gotten advice on appointing conservative supreme court justices he also says he wants vice president that can help navigate the congressional process so find your conclusions puzzling	0
katich could be the concierge of the new luxury trump hotel in dc on pennsylvania ave couple of blocks from the white house trump project that rebuilt the old shut-down huge washington central post office retaining the essential outer castle-like shape while renovating the interior from scratch opens under budget and ahead of schedule in september in plenty of time for the inauguration of the next american president not the next islamofascist president	0
teddy rubio and katich are driving me toward trump was ted supporter but not now their last names might was well be clinton	0
hey we all get it we the little people no longer the people don matter any more if our sons daughter wives husbands get killed by an illegal that ok because we are showing compassion to the poor and down-trodden who come to our country to live off of our generous welfare benefits and demand the laws of our land don apply to them after all they re not citizens so why should the be held accountable to our laws you ve got to love the perverted logic of the progressives and their chosen people we are fools and tools who sit around and do nothing to stop it we actually support idiots like cruz rubio katich et al who want to make the united states better place for the illegals while making it living hell for us how these people aren being run out of town on the rail after being tarred and feathered is beyond me better yet they blame the violence of these illegals and their progressive supporters on us rubio katich and cruz can go straight to hell if they love their illegals so much move to mexico hear that it is hell on earth the congress courts and executive branch are full of traitors	0
every ohioan ve talked to rolls their eyes when asked about kasich don really think they like him much but the political machine was already in place denying trump ohio is katich only purpose in life	0
when ted cruz rubio and katich have the opportunity to stand in unity against the leftist mob instead they chose to align with and defend the bernie sanders supporters moveon and the chicago obama thugs does anyone really believe senator ted cruz rubio or katich would stand up to the mob to defend your assembly and free speech rights actions spear louder than words people lastly last week we saw the media latch on to story about mr trumps pledge and the media release pics of the event with people holding their right hands up saying it was natzi rally is anyone one surprised something like this would happen any fault media	0
katich was up by five points now he is even if that trend continues katich loses and when trump takes ohio and fla this race is done	0
when ted cruz rubio and katich have the opportunity to stand in unity against the leftist mob instead they chose to align with and defend the bernie sanders supporters moveon and the chicago obama thugs does anyone really believe senator ted cruz rubio or katich would stand up to the mob to defend your assembly and free speech rights actions spear louder than words people	0

well there you go cruz katich and rubio are all bought and paid for and you can get any worse that that scum george soros hope everybody also knows that katich is for full blown amnesty and is in favor of every damn one of these job killing trade deals it trump or bust this country will continue on the exact same track as europe if trump doesn win it really is that simple	0
ohio don vote for katich he will destroy you on the way to destroying america trump	0
katich got all of his thoughts from lenin and marx	0
seriously are you so dumb that you can tell the difference between business deal from years ago and soros directly funding katich for president of the usa trump doesn owe soros damn thing in kasich owes him his soul	0
all other candidates but trump have some odd funding or people speaking for them katich soros donation same soros as the guy behind moveon og that claimed responsibility for friday night in chicago	0
katich is pissed that his campaign plan from the git go was to steal it on the floor it didn work and he is now finished as national politician say good riddance	0
think trump will have problems with utah nebraska montana and the dakotas there some very strait-laced people in those states as much as hate it he needs to team up with katich or cruz which one of the two is the least likely to have him taken out let see how he does in utah before we panic love trump no contested convention fools	0
katich should have dropped out months ago really why is he still in there	0
katich is dummy plant to slow down trump in one state kasich barely beat trump in his own state you suck	0
ericson is total as swipe in how he is going after brokered convention placing katich on the ballot when he failed to meet the criteria is despicable considering no one can challenge busted eligibility on the merits we are officially insane and no longer in constitutional republic with rule of law	0
eh would much rather see kasich drop out so we can disprove their theory that cruz can beat trump head to head once and for all they re all stuck on bs hypothetical polls and this bs idea that every rubio and katich supporter will automatically go to cruz they re wrong	0
john kasich oh is missing from this list oh wait he won refuse it not christian yeah right sure katich is an embarrassment to me and live in oh and gop and if he joins in this will personally apologize to him but he won	0
katich is liberal carson has said no to ever being trumps vp he says they are too different don really know what carson even stands for he just seems to go along whenever something pops up don know about him nice guy but he just doesn come out with real policies	0
wow how low this mighty libertarian has fallen joining hands with jeb katich and fiorino to block and tackle against the people choice since mcconnell has endorsed him reckon he got his marching odors mean orders	0
traitor katich endorses brain damaged traitor clinton	0
katich suffers from grandiosity of narcissism he believed god told him that he would win in and when it turned out he didn kasich turned to the am always right syndrome of narcissism too bad now he is subverting the will of ohioans by supporting tpp over the jobs of millions of americans vote the bum out	0
have no problem with rino liar that pledged to support the gop candidate being run over by the trump train all can say to katich is ripp rest in political peace your credibility and relevance is done as far as am concerned	0
katich is still throwing hissy fit yuck	0
the new black panthers have said that they ll be carrying at the convention the cleveland police have asked katich to rescind open carry and he says that its not within his power to do so	0
katich is racist and bought and paid for globalist elite puppet totally on the take just like ryan obama and clinton	0
you know when type kasich the spell-check keeps overwriting with katich see even spell-check does not recognize or like k-suck it an omen tell ya man who takes money from george soros is no good in my books he is not pro-life he is pro amnesty and promised to pass an amnesty bill within the first days maybe he just might get the vote from the girl in framingham ma who was gang-raped by four guatemalans	0
how much do you want to bet john katich super pac new day for america is behind this smear from politico	0
of the people won vote for cruz and won vote for katich don care if like the person is he liar no has he accomplished something in his life yes however do like him respect him for having the guts to lay it all on the line for america	0
have had it with rinos myself agree that the republican establishment is worse than the liberals they have been lying to us just to win landslide elections am just nauseated by contemplating what hillary presidency would do to our future she alone is more dishonest that the entire gop establishment combined besides cruz and trump are definitely no the gop establishment not sure rubio is either however he is sure courting their votes katich definitely is	0
ohio please keep your gov katich at home as he is so tiring repeating the sos over over at every debate	0
katich is freking moron with permanent duck face	0
very surprised katich would be so bold as to make such brave statement the real question is what the heck is the man doing in the presidential race he not running national campaign he has become celebrity and it now time for people to get him out of there the race	0
well there goes any chance that kasich has for the vp pick and cruz can write off any dreams that he has of the supreme court trump will now run the table and get the we the people can smell rat and we don like it especially from professional politicians and lawyers katich started in politics in and cruz is typical lawyer neither profession is held in high esteem by the majority of americans trump on the other hand has never been in politics before nor is he lawyer he is wildly successful international businessman right now our country needs someone with good business sense to unscramble the mess that our country is in from decades of professional politicians of both parties and unscrupulous lawyers this election is crossroads for our country choose wisely do we want more of the same type of professionals who got us into this mess or do we want proven problem solver who knows how to create jobs business and make profit while doing it oh and did mention true american patriot vote trump to make america great again	0
trump needs to show ohio who katich is like the others he dispatched than he ll take ohio besides the way hillary is flopping around like dying fish her campaign might never make it to the finish line	0
it virtually impossible for trump to win all ny delegates the fact that it would require wins in all congressional districts negates that possibility trump will get the largest portion but katich and cruz will also win some	0
katich and carly	0
katich is one-trick pony and will never be the nominee	0
how about anyone but all of them could never vote for rubio cruz yeb katich christie santorum that leaves trump might be taking chance with him but with everyone else already know what am getting and it aint good this time rather than doing what always did and getting what always got gonna try something new and as business owner can gladly say trump all the way	0

gotta say hate katich but love the ad lol	0
kasich voted for nafta which destroyed our middle class kasich was also lehman bros bank manager when the bank crash occurred kasich largest donor is george soros to the tune of katich is part of the corrupt establishment uni-party	0
and we need to let open borders globalist conservatism die even more urgently cpac throws out katich then should also throw out cruz and rubio	0
what bunch of hypocrites at cpac including conservative icon malkin slamming katich for common core but giving mysterious pass to trust ted after he committed disgraceful voter fraud and tampering in iowa when it is clear that he is not natural born citizen by the constitutional definition and is therefore ineligible after he voted yea on legalizing million illegals after he voted yea on corker bill that made it impossible to stop obamatrade after he voted yea on obama crown jewel obamatrade tpp which senator sessions warns devastates american sovereignty and security and even after he wrote legislations to increase visas to replace american workers with foreigners by wow what stellar group of constitutional principled conservatives at least katich is eligible to serve as potus	0
lets realize that we have current cic who thinks he knows everything and acts unilaterally trump is an executive that convenes group of experts to advise him on matters of importance he then has them generate plan for his approval and then executes the plan we don need the lone ranger we need true executive unlike john kasich trump has built viable company and grew to over katich explains how great balancing the budget is maybe we need someone who has created consistent surplus of funds just the opinion of an old not so uneducated trump supporter	0
kasich who the hell is katich	0
in previous primary when you can win you get out and support the leader this is supposed to give the party the best shot at winning the general election the establishment katich and cruz can win republican party is in shambles	0
so did kasich he was democrat and cruz has adopted all of donald trumps ideas katich even uses commonsense government like dt go freakin figure	0
who in the world truly gives damn if katich even votes this article space could ve been used for an advertisement been least of value	0
katich lied about supporting the republican winner which means his word is no good he is continuing to do what he has done his whole life serving himself screwing everyone else	0
katich ship has left him and he desperately hates the ship captain	0
katich sure turned out to be joke not enough intelligence to recognize the only way to stop leftist takeover of the us is to select the only viable alternative like trump or not he is not working for the establishment to destroy america	0
katich will always be remembered as man with no integrity	0
katich is pure white trash and should be purged from the party he actually tried to destroy trump ground game in ohio but the pos only wound up destroying his own reputation he has no standing any longer in the republican party	0
hillary is exactly what we are going to get with cruz and katich playing these games they should be ashamed of themselves	0
true but katich does it so well	0
trump is patriot we haven seen one in long time obama hillary kerry are all traitors and have greed disease katich is delusional did someone promise him the job cruz is establishment and creepy plus we are already fighting isis do we really want fundamentalist president trump will bring in the best and the brightest because he knows how to delegate to smart people clinton and obama are so arrogant they surrounded themselves with dopey people so they would look good come on charles you see it know you do	0
blaming trump for the disruptive and at times violent organized protests has put cruz katich and rubio in the position of advocating the same kind of argument that clinton sanders and obama advance when they blame the united states for the rise of isis and the anti-us sentiment in iran instead of pinning responsibility on those who disrupt peaceful speech they blame the speaker this tortured psychological politically correct analysis however true in part it may be is at odds with the philosophy of the conservative movement which focuses attention on accepting personal responsibility for one behavior we need to protect the speaker from protestors whose objective is to prevent the speaker from being heard by disrupting the rally while the behavior of these protestors does not violate the first amendment the bill of rights protects us from the acts of government-not the acts of individuals- technical legal distinction the media have not explained organized and paid protests-storming the stage-and engaging in acts to disrupt peaceful assembly may constitute criminal and civil violations of the civil rights acts and the justice department should investigate to determine if the acts of the protestors are protected acts of free speech or if they have lost that protection by non-speech acts storming the stage in any event blaming the speaker for the acts of hoodlums misplaces responsibility and justifies improper behavior	0
his voters are the problem he is just typical islamobum wanting free plane rides	0
if we could just send her to islamobum land she would destroy it in year	0
oh he just needs to read the constitution and believe in liberal-ty and he ll magically become good murican been hearing from the gop for some years these guys are natural conservatives the word you choose	1

where is obama birth certificate we need real murican patriot like strike canadian strike ted cruz	1
language of the second amendment syntactically implies that madison and the other signers intended the amendment to refer to militia not to half-cocked lone gunmen it is typical of the insanity of conservatives that they trumpet strict construction for the constitution and bill of rights though they aren educated enough to know strict construction is the correct phrase but have insufficient knowledge of grammar and hermeneutics to have clue about how to interpret authorial intention from syntax and context long live murican anti-intellectualism more stringent gun controls needed now	1
anti-white bigotry is celebrated by leftist corporations and the murican government stop using their services and vote the animals out of office or it going to keep getting worse the white is being fattened up poorly educated and falling under government control slowly and it in my opinion already too late we re finished	1
also those bozo were voted in because we were tired of the democrips tearing up america and then we get backstabbed by the people we voted in there no longer difference between demo and repub it all the same thing now they work together to screw over the murican public	1
but conservatives love government in their bedrooms and inside of other people bodies it the murican way	1

what is known about benghazi today was published in canada free press within few weeks of the event as we learn more that report appears in retrospect to accurately describe the substance of what went on in beghazi and the reasons why things went wrong in future any analysis of this debacle should also include discussion of the removal by the president of military commanders who objected to his hapless response during the ongoing turmoil the us political left and its handmaiden media are truly criminal conspiracy	0

he ro hir noun noun hero plural noun heroes noun hero sandwich plural noun hero sandwiches person typically man who is admired or idealized for courage outstanding achievements or noble qualities war hero an ambassador that gets others killed protecting him does not make said ambassador hero the other guys that died were paid contractors there to earn money the cia was there doing wrong things the ambassador was the front for state dept and cia there was zero altruism or selfless sacrifice in almost everything about beghazi killary and president hussien should be hip deep in trouble over what they were really doing which was illegally running weapons to people they hoped would receive and use them but something went wrong as so often happens when we do wrong things do see where the backwater employees showed bravery but to save their own asses because our leaders who sent them there shouldn have and left them to die to cover themselves why isn anyone looking at why this all took place iran-contra sure got lot of ink and airtime in the how is this different	0

hillary failures are of epic proportions capped by beghazi moreover she has accepted too much money and favors from saudi arabia creating mount everest conflict of interest don believe she is running out off patriotis rather desire for power money and self-gratification she owes too many favors to foreign governments especially in the mdeast	0

well it worked for that liar why not this one because this is not back in things were better much better than they are today in america and in the world that is why america has tired of liars has tired of enemies of america walking all over us tired of those white flags of surrender and just tired of the democratzi loonatics who have done more damage in america than any enemy landing on our shores that is why hillary did not take the am call for help beghazi did not keep her oath of office to preserve and protect ambassador stevens and others left to guard him when all others were removed and now she wants to do the same for america not on my watch	0

now your lying it absolutely has happened by driving the administration to intervention in libya arms from the and our allies in the region ended up in the hands of al-qaeda-backed militias according to report in the washington times the paper has detailed clinton previously unknown actions in the lead up to the war in three part series today is the final installment the question that many in congress might want to ask is if clinton determination to intervene in libya eventually led to the attack on our compound in beghazi libyan officials were deeply concerned in as secretary of state hillary rodham clinton was trying to remove moammar gadhafi from power that weapons were being funneled to nato-backed rebels with ties to al qaeda fearing that well-armed insurgents could create safe haven for terrorists according to secret intelligence reports obtained by the washington times the reports included page list of weapons that libyans supposedly tracked to the rebels from western sources or their allies in the region the memos were corroborated by intelligence asset familiar with the documents as well as former top gadhafi regime official mohammed ismael nato has given permission to number of weapons-loaded aircraft to land at benghazi airport and some tunisian airports the intelligence report said identifying masses of weapons including tanks and surface-to-air missiles that report which was prepared in english so it could be passed by intelligence asset to key members of congress identified specific air and sea shipments observed by libyan intelligence moving weapons to the rebels trying to unseat the gadhafi regime there is close link between al qaeda jihadi organizations and the opposition in libya the report warned in the documents and separately recorded conversations with emissaries libyan officials expressed particular concern that the weapons and training given the rebels would spread throughout the region in particular turning the city of benghazi into future terrorist haven those fears would be realized little over year later when band of jihadist insurgents attacked the state department diplomatic post in benghazi and related cia compound killing four americans including ambassador christopher stevens today more than three years after gadhafi fell from power and was killed benghazi and much of the rest of libya remain in chaos riddled with violence among rival tribes and thriving jihadi groups	0
here whooper found wikileaks crookedhillary did order beghazi stand down link no one ordered military assets to move but clinton gave an order to stand down of course military assets were moved but were unable to get any further than italy before the benghazi attack was complete and there is no doubt that any state department would be concerned about the procedures for having an american military force attack in sovereign nation but was there such an order contrary to issa statement it is not only completely deniable it has been denied by everyone involved including all of the witnesses interviewed by the benghazi committee	0
it only becomes racist when the leftist sos in the media need to create it for that purpose why we certainly don want to cover hitlery and her health issues and mail issues and beghazi and the russian reset and etc ad nauseum	0

technically gross incompetence is not crime in that sense no crime was found in regards to the beghazi incident in regards to the email scandal she admitted to breaking several laws as to proper use and storage of classified information but since obama said it didn endanger national security before he had any evidence one way or the other then guess it ok kind of like robbing bank but bringing the money back	0
hillary is the butcher of beghazi and you are troll	0

trump has promised spend many billions and billions of taxpayer dollars on rebuilding our roads bridges airports and the veterans administration but how is he going to get that passed by republican congress only obsessed with beghazi and planned parenthood	0
hit her on beghazi lying to parents and then her emails giving up classifiedinfo	0
trump needs to go over the head of the next moderator and start off the debate asking hillary why she thinks she above the law because others have gone to jail for doing less than she has done he needs to follow up with the next question why she thought her political career was more important than the lives lost at beghazi then ask hillary why she is for sanctuary cities and allowing illegal alien criminals safe haven in sanctuary cities	0
don forget beghazi benghazi benghazi carly first ambassador lost since the along with three other heroes benghazi is all hillary	0
wait wait so the press will attack trump for his trump ties yet they let hilary blunder in beghazi just float by as if nothing happened this is typical liberal meeting trying to discount the entire gop field br br while people died in benghazi our image as nation partially ruined trumps business dealings continue to make front page press no one ever talks to all the hotels real estate buildings employees he has given jobs to br br just the times trying to find dirt to fit their liberal bias	0
what makes you think fox is our own are you big michael moore fan is he one of our own too fox is busy trying to take scalps prioritized by how anti-establishment you are while the other side gets softball questions jeb and kaisch should not even be on the stage fox is clearly in the pockets of the establishment so if you are part of the establishment then sure they are your own but most people here if you haven figured it out yet loath the donor class puppets	0
one more sell-out being shown for what he really is hope they paid you well to kill off your political career cruz there isn leftie faux outrage you won get behind fast enough if you think it will help you win we expected it from kaisch but seeing it from you is pathetic	0
not according to kaisch trust the made up polls or trust the gut instinct of millions of red blooded americans think that will go with the latter	0
at this point it doesn matter as we were talking about politics this holiday with many friends we have all agreed that if cruz is nominated or ryan romney kaisch bush trump voters will stay home including us if it not cruz it seems the cruz bots will stay home don know how they will react to romney or ryan bush kaisch as no one supporting cruz was here to say am only speculating on the cruzbots staying home and not voting trump the blood is to bad between the camps and we want nothing to do with lyin ted	0
when does the cruz campaign announce that kaisch is dropping out of the race in wisconsin	0
latest poll out done nationally asked republicans said trump with cruz kaisch the rest so what does that tell you yes cruz will do good in some states usually the ones that do not matter in the general election texas aside but the ones that matter which includes the biggest swing state not ohio florida trump wins in landslide	0
so they times this pretty well its nothing significant the press will have field day trump will probably be leaned on to fire lewandowski the slimeball kaisch will benefit	0
self deportation for kaisch and other simpletons mandatory e-verify for all employees and independent contractors failure of e-verify results in an immediate increase of payroll taxes to any attempt of circumvention or falsification of e-verify will result in no less than and months incarceration per count where applicable corporate officers personal assets will be seized first so as not to create hardship to working us citizens there you go kaisch that was unbelievably tough rounding up those million law breakers no one is separating families no one is going door-to-door it called putting americans first you should have tried it when you were in office	0
these anti-deporting morons like kaisch need to use their heads first take away all the entitlements we re giving illegals food stamps welfare housing health care etc then stop their ability to work and earn living the majority of them will self-deport	0
kaisch has been to too many lobbyist parties filled with wine women and song it burnt out his brain how is it that can get rid of the illegal immigrant problem while keeping families together for and somehow he can the guy has been sucking on the taxpayer teat for far too long	0
kaisch is asking valid question what is the mechanics of the plan to round up million illegals	0
it is amazing how much smarter than john kaisch am can figure out how to get the vast majority of illegals out of the country by new years	0
hey kaisch did lehman brothers do good job too	0
winning ohio would be such victory considering kaisch has done everything to prevent this win	0
kaisch has no shot at winning he is working for brokered convention just like rubio	0
kaisch is another jerry sandusky	0
john kaisch looks like pervert according to my daughter	0
none of the polling for second choices has shown anything like what you claim many voters think cruz is religious zealot so lot those people would prefer trump over cruz if they re favoring kaisch now	0
facts they say are hard things especially when the facts fly in the face of our fairy-tales we have created especially when those fairy-tales revolve around person who worships the constitution of the us applauded ted cruz for years and waited with eager anticipation for the day the white knight of constitutional conservatives would ride in on his steed and impale the wicked progressive dragon hillary on his lance of truth sadly ted cruz is an impostor of the worst kind his wife is employed by and he is funded by goldman sachs heidi cruz was member of the council on foreign relations and worked on plan for north american union that would supplant the sovereignty of the usa ted has proven that he will not address the issue of illegal and legal immigration with the seriousness it demands ted is funded by big money gop insiders just like everyone before him at least bernie sanders has rejected such funding bernie has more campaign morals than ted ted cruz pulled low-life attack on ben carson in iowa ted cruz is not mainstream protestant christian he may attend southern baptist church but it interesting that robert jeffress of first baptist dallas and franklin graham have not endorsed ted although they are leaders in the southern baptist convention his father reared him in the pentecostal tradition and ted biggest religious endorsement is from the mormon glenn beck can find where ted own pastor has endorsed him by the way bill clinton and al gore were southern baptist ted cruz has been involved in sexual affairs period please see the above youtube link ted nor amanda carpenter have filed suit against the enquirer again enough said if he had one ounce of decency he would leave the race and deal with his family issues however like another presidential candidate we all know the love of power is greater than the love of family and decency remember bill clinton weathered the storm of his indiscretions because the machine protected him for their agenda ted is being protected because he is an important part of the establishment game plan read on to see what that is ted cruz has no chance of winning the nomination it is mathematical impossibility therefore he is staying in the race for other reasons than winning the nomination ted cruz paid the carly fiorina pac fact there is no logical reason to do this none therefore it was to pay off cruz mistress and fiorina staffer sarah isgur flores even if the gop goes to brokered convention cruz will not be the nominee the wranglers have already decided who will come out of the brokered convention as the anointed one paul ryan the other side of the ticket will get you it john kasich maybe they told ted by playing ball he will get on the scotus hope he doesn believe them cruz kaisch and the gop are apoplectic because their globalist establishment apple cart has been upended like it or not trump is the people choice he is the only person who has stab at the delegates necessary if the gop through it machinations steals this nomination from trump hope he and sanders form third-party ticket they would have my vote if for no other reason like to be on the winning side and they would win ryan clinton clinton period trump clinton trump one-third of sanders voters will not vote for clinton there you go if you love cruz you love cruz me love the usa and will stand behind the one man who is not bought by the super pacs and who after years in the eye of the media has withstood every single attack all of his enemies have thrown in this campaign	0
so what is kaisch for	0
know this is not even close to being repeat of the presidential election far differently donald trump began as gop candidate unalike independent ross perot during the primaries bush walked away with million of the populace vote buchanan nearly million perot approx mind you we are only one month into the primaries trump has already exceeded million populace votes trump current only one month in is far cry from perot in lieu of such the gop really better start rethinking their possible plans because hundreds of thousands will march on the cleveland convention center if you dare to nullify trump voters and deservingly so respectfully submitted from ohio where many of us also recognize what kaisch did cheating on ohio results telling ya between the gop demand that trump sign an agreement to support the winner and the actions of the other two candidates the gop since reluctance to support trump the gop party has stirred up an absolute hornet nest	0
outshines wtf kaisch would get run over by either the lying tch htilery or the communist bernie he has many of their same policies it is impossible for him to argue he is the better candidate when he has the same policies on illegal aliens and immigration he is the same on ovomitcare he supports it he is the same on trade deals he supports tpp nafta etc he is mclame and romney all over again what kaisch ensures is third ovomit term which is what the rinos in our party want anyway barron wsj open borders massive illegal aliens massive immigration in regards to business news no one reads barron anymore whatever they are saying about the business is already week old weekly news magazines are dying or dead trump	0
let me be brutally frank am year old black woman former democrat turned independent in and will be voting for donald trump let me tell you why obama who did not vote for promised to transform america nobody insisted he explain what he meant or how he would carry this out his policy of allowing unfettered illegal immigration is designed to change this majority white america into minority you white folks are so dumb because you argue among yourselves about petty things while this president is stealing this country that you built along with my ancestors right out from under you trump is your only chance to keep your country and you won acknowledge it nothing is more important than that cruz rubio bush kaisch christie or none of the other candidates give mn about not allowing this to happen they just want to be president only trump wants to be president for the right reasons please save our country by voting for trump	0
iff as you say you re fully indoctrinated then curious why you think that the sign of accomplishment for conservative is the number of bills that he has authored and sure you re familiar with kaisch big government growth in ohio and while in his years in congress of course would consider growing government to be the opposite of an accomplishment then again making an enemy of both harry reid and mitch mcconnell is something would consider an accomplishment but of course you have lots of excrement and have been serious student of politics since carter ford or as would have put it ford carter now you could consider your same arguments on the donald his history is filled with liberal causes and positions in fact up until last year he had no causes in line with gop other than the old familiar crony-capitalism but then you know best because you listen to your buddy sean but not to your old buddies glenn and mark sigh they must be devastated that they can no longer give you the straight facts	0
go out and vote for cruz rubio and kaisch loser romney btw ted sat in the audience during romney diatribe and clapped like trained seal	0
drudge poll has trump winning debate and cruz at kaisch and rubio before anyone say drudge polls are bs the fact is you can only vote once unless you use another device with different ip address not many people going to go through that much trouble over debate poll at drudge lastly every drudge poll has been dead on correct including states won by trump and the percentage points he lead with personally think cruz did great job don know what kasich is one thing for sure he is no republican his views are liberalism trump won the debate he managed to walk away without any damage despite the obvious hatred from fox and little marco attacks	0
oh sure but he did an amazing job building projects and putting deals together his later deals got better as well he didn get as much handed to him as say mittens rubio kaisch and cruz have never done anything substantial ever neither has hillary neither has the bern gates and jobs did heck of lot of good stuff but plenty of mess ups too remember jobs about ran apple into the ground first time and was even more anti-competition with closed system only apple could write software for gates jobs also copied lot of ideas and much of what they did was hype anyhow they all have warts	0
kaisch gave the only truly disquieting stupid and he should be done answer of the night he talked about mobilizations of mass numbers of troops to syria iraq and libya those areas are impossible to stabilize and it will never work that was the only real tidbit of the night the other was trump went easy on marco marco marco	0
he going to go down on kaisch at tonight after debate foam party	0
kaisch is an a-hole	0
absolutely biased trump should do no more debates fox is despicable they air an attack ad from kaisch as question and then megyn rattles off rubio points on trump it is ridiculous notice no questions to trump about jobs or reforming trade	0
kaisch love thy enemy and care for thy neighbor idiot	0
the so-called debate was little more than dog pile on trump and aside from kaisch none of the other candidates did anything but attack neither cruz or rubio made the case tonight that they are worthy of being president	0
kaisch feeding at the trough for eternity you re the last thing we need more of	0
kaisch out democrats democrats	0
like kaisch he would be good vp for trump	0
like kaisch	0
kaisch he the standard establishment caver-in reach-across-the-aisle bend over backwards to please the left he fox cup of tea	0
thought the worst answer from tonights debate kaisch the guy was talking about troops all over arabia oh just special operators or major mobilization little of both trump the trump thing bit him then he weakened on blah don waiver the trump is just real estate investing seminar think most of them are ripoffs as the material is fairly early to learn but an easy answer on these things is talking about what the course is and noting that any course any of them are to an extent unnecessary just did an antenna class can pick it up by using book but bit easier with good instructor ted blah just hard to like him he had some high and mighty sounding answers and came across as the obstinate guy that can work with people rubio just can explain himself and has nothing to stand on other than claiming he has principles he is as trump called him light weight	0
neither and the best thing that can happen is that trump runs in the general election and is defeated by clinton in four years the republican party will be able to regroup around more sensible candidates and present better candidate for as it stands trump and cruz are both unacceptable candidates rubio and kaisch are good candidates but don have the strength just yet four years should improve the picture for conservative republican voters	0
he did lose this one just everyone else sucked enough not to win kaisch would be killing hillary in the democratic primary	0
can you imagine you president have table manners like kaisch eating like cow imagine dining the princesses of india and you have this fool slouching over eating pork and slobbing over food	0
why has that fat lard kaisch not dropped out yet	0
maybe missed it has kaisch dropped yet time to unite and focus on the destruction of hitlery	0
congrats team trump excellent showing thank you ted cruz for bowing out kaisch take notice and follow suit time to get behind your candidate lets cook hillary goose	0
kaisch gutierrez viva la raza	0
thought he would never shut up cruz next up kaisch	0
cruz will he dump carly for falling down and say he misspoke and appoint kaisch as his puppet vp	0
kaisch announced he is staying in the race and said to vote for him if want to stop trump never trump is this guy insane how the people of ohio tolerating this guy	0
kaisch won get out he an asshole	0
other candidates will surpass trump and or carson as the weak candidates drop out those for jindal santorum kaisch etc will not go for carson or trump nor will the undecided trump will not stay in if he drops to third heard it somewhere yesterday and agree	0
hey flake go join kaisch at the ihop	0
egg mcmuffin and dirt bag flake and mccain can all write in each other name on their ballots and add em all up and you get kaisch like numbers bees nuts wipes the floor with egg mcmuffin	0
kaisch is despicable	0
kaisch ted and hillary have the same foreign policy of waging more war and sending troops end of story	0
the taxpayers have no obligation to support illegal immigrants we did not decide to allow them to come here but hillary will give away the farm to win votes and that why someone like cruz or kasich will lose to her cruz will talk policy that no one cares about and kaisch will try to out democrat hillary	0
it great trump is doing so well and so early in the race let hope it continues as to the also rans when are they going to just give up jeb the loser jabba the hut chrissy tax and spend kaisch even rubio the kid amnesty lovers all drop out already losers	0
all the bench sitting republicans now have the best reason in the world to finally stand up and support trump hillary and her campaign have been caught red handed instigating violence at the rallies of her opposition citizen lives were put at risk trump never did anything like that to fail to stand with trump now--even if they aren wildly enthusiastic about him--is to instead stand with those who propagate violence to win an election where does that end answer it results in more violence all republicans--jeb kaisch and on and on are supporting violence by not supporting trump they have no excuse now is the time for all true patriots to rise and be counted support trump	0
would rather see jen goober graham crusty and kaisch quit	0
who is the next to withdraw the establishment is regretting their illusion of choice strategy for this round they sent out host of throw away candidates to combat people like rand paul or ted cruz turns out they are now getting crushed by the outsiders all the decoys perry walker kaisch graham etc will now be withdrawn so that their meager following can be picked up by heb or rubibeiber	0
your tool bag kaisch is not who voted for trump is do not reply to me	0
if it were drug cartel muslims as some are speculating they wouldn mind killing child would assume from their record am assuming family feud of some sort or maybe local drug dealer you never know completely aweful the three year old will probably remember this for the rest of their life from an ohioan would have liked to see something more from kaisch maybe talk with family members or something just terrible	0
kaisch	0
heads up gop establishment if any rino like bush rubio or kaisch is the nominee you just handed the white house to the dems	0
corner west might say vote for kaisch or rubio is vote for four more years of obama	0
still don know why kaisch isn running on the democrat ticket he is an unapologetic advocate for amnesty for illegal aliens and big government	0
believe romney is prog putz like the rest of the chamberpot repubs bushie iii huckleberry chrissie kaisch rubeo pox on them	0
perry had his shot in and punked out he christie pataki huckabee kaisch santorum graham and even carson and fiorina should drop out of the field	0
nick stop spewing the bs the cleveland police wanted the open carry suspended not the attendees kaisch said no did anything happen at the convention no why because they had law and order and certain many of the attendees were armed just like the protestors sitting outside holding their ar	0
anyone see kaisch after the attacks he said we cant divide but we need to come together and not single out muslims actually kaisch we need to do the exact opposite and remove all muslims maybe when there own lives finally disrupted the so called good ones lol maybe they will finally come out against terrorism by the way kaisch hillary and bernie said the same thing how coincidental right	0
from the old saturday night live with dan akroyd and jane curtain jane you ignorant slut except change jane to john kaisch you little wussie man challenge you and your claims are we on	0
condemned it as soon as it came out of his mouth that is not acceptable and that john jesus-told-me-to-implement-obamacare-in-ohio kaisch is why you are one of the ers and not in good way	0
kaisch komedy team	0
would we the kaisch comedy team count that as supporter or bot lmao	0
yo kaisch you got supporters on this site it been awhile since ve done this kind of math but total comments supporters support you rino lmfao	0
kaisch commits suicide on his governorship	0
comments not for pos rino illegal loving hater of middle class taxpayers of usa kaisch lmao	0
cuckservative definition see mailman kid lehman brother former employer obamacare loving rino john kaisch	0
add kaisch to that list of jealous as well as jeb think it is the idea of feeling entitled they all believe they are super brains with everybody else well below them they know better for us they have that in common with obama trump often asks the public what they think he isn creating policy by asking his bubble friends he is putting the debate right out in public for discussion politicians never do that because first they do not care and secondly the exposure is dangerous look what trump has been put through by being blunt and exposing his belief system that is why clinton has the public face and the private belief system	0
golly holding trump to high standard not sure what you mean could you give me some examples of how they would persuade congress from some of the other candidates like cruz or kaisch or hillary cruz has always batted zero in the senate hillary introduced and passed no legislation and kaisch doesn have gingrich to clear the way for him anymore haven heard much about how they would woo congress either or maybe you re just waving red herring tmskonours	0
they do they re voting for trump instead of fake christian with dildo midget and hooker fetish if you re the only one who can beat hildog would you like to explain why you re bottom feeder like kaisch right now he beating you few places even	0
mr cruz and mr kaisch are there for the same reason to secure their positions in the romney bush make america drowsy again administration the establishment is hoping to shove down our throats on the second ballot when that ticket inevitably loses to ms clinton surprising no one except the republican elite both mr cruz and mr kaisch will get nice fat pacs set up for their next campaigns those two aren there humbling themselves they re securing their payoffs for siphoning votes from mr trump	0
have never seen front runner poll numbers collapse like this cruz now in front at wi and surging in ca and ny polls kaisch tied in pen what going on with trump	0
oh for cryin out loud pa get it together kaisch policies will bury more jobs in pa and we need that like another hole in the head same with cruz and his btt dont blow it	0
have you really thought about that and how unreliable polls are if cruz and kaisch can beat hillary and trump is beating cruz and kaisch in the primaries than how can trump lose to hillary unless there is whole lot of fraudulent statistical manipulation going in hillary poll numbers are going to crash when the outcome of the fbi investigation is released or leaked	0
they ll use that bs even though kaisch just has ohio under his belt that well he made to the end therefore its not exactly taking it away from trump	0
the super is pro cruz pac not republican or rubio or kaisch but cruz he knew exactly what was going on	0
kaisch is now tied to trump in latest pen poll	0
what these hard headed gop voters who back cruz kaisch because they do not like how trump talks give me break the world is going to hell and you get upset about some one saying it like it is dont understand that hillary already has one foot in the and unless trump is nominated she will be moving in the furniture she stole on her way out back in	0
he was truly shut down that last debate no doubt that was so shoddy and obvious on cnn part they kept allowing that fiorino to interrupt and kaisch that was wrong what happened there hopefully the next debate is fair one though have my doubts down and both were bad	0
mitchel do you have any idea what the globalists want what they will do please learn about cultural marxism you obviously care about life but you are being played cruz will not do anything about abortion because his handlers won let him look at how he has cozied up to the globalist establishment in his quest for the nomination eg what this deal with kaisch who is against much of what you and believe think didn bush both of them old and remember both quite weil talk pro-life got us to vote for them on that basis what their record awful all talk no action cruz is bush tool the global establishment must be stopped for the sake of the babies	0
the best part of the plan less than hours into it mr kaisch implores indiana voters to vote for him either he hoodwinked mr cruz making mr kaisch liar and mr cruz gullible mr cruz just lied about what the deal said or in rush to grab headline they both signed deal they didn understand making them both liars and gullible at the same time any way you cut it this deal exposes them both as the members of the political class some of us have known them to be all along	0
so wonder if anyone realizes when cruz and kaisch agree to keep trump out they are telling we the people despite who you want we will work the system to get what we big government wants yet there are still voters for these guys wtf we all knew the system was curropt but when they come out and say it right to our face and people just accept this you accept having no voice in your government wake up people this is no longer democracy delegates have nothing to do with majority vote it all about propaganda trump stop children what that sound everybody look whats goin down	0
if you actually think the republicans will deny trump your just listening to the gossips forget the election they lose if they deny trump trump has clearly won theres no path other than being spoiler and delegate stealer that card does not work because the people who voted for the front runner will be very upset that record turnout will dwindle and cruz or kaisch or the white knight gope candidate will lose badly in return they will destroy the party from within and lose any seat in the house or the senate any policy they stand for is at risk immigration will get worse gun control will happen universal health care for nation of million people on top of that they lose the supreme court of justice seats they lose everything trump won go out quietly in that scenario either he will run third party to make sure they lose and third party down the road will emerge	0
nationalist not populist and cruz and kaisch are both throwing hail mairys cruz is showing his true colors and kaisch was already an establishment hack trump supporters like myself have had it with the republican party and without trump will leave	0
kaisch is snake and cruz is chump if he thinks he can trust him	0
repost kaisch had shot as vp to trump now he will be back in private sector after his term ends in years what fool cruz had shot at scotus when trumps wins election now cruz will be running for department of sanitation- toile bowl division when he loses senate re-election bid in few years bigger winner donald trump	0
kaisch had shot as vp to trump now he will be back in private sector after his term ends in years what fool cruz had shot at scotus when trumps wins election now cruz will be running for department of sanitation- toile bowl division when he loses re-election bid in few years bigger winner donald trump	0
sure and even less voted for cruz and kaisch not wanting that to turn into mitt romeny pr paul ryan either giving the delegates to other candidates is sucky process especially when it seems like insiders have been stacking the deck for cruz colorado	0
so here the possibilities mr kaisch just decided to break the deal mr cruz lied about the deal mr cruz didn understand what the deal was in rush to grab some headlines both campaigns made deal neither understood no matter which it is do any of these explanations give you any confidence in sending mr cruz or mr kaisch to negotiate with the russians or chinese never mind congress	0
they still like bush christi and kaisch	0
kaisch bush christi and rubio are the same as clinton and she says she is the same as obama	0
kaisch is naughty naughty boy milton	0
have to disagree with you there is no way in hell that cruz is worse then the obummer also don think he is worse then the majority of the other gop nominee example jebby boy amnesty razza rubio kaisch huckster ect am going to vote for trump but if in some way trump is not our nominee and it was cruz would vote for cruz the rest of them would do write in trump	0
first the rnc gope picked jeb then rubio then kaisch then lyin ted cruz the rnc gope is dead and gone rip	0
who is the pig what is down ballot killer what are you trying to say the general election has not started yet hillary might be under indictment trump is good at hitting hard the world is exploding with jihad and illegal crimes and the fuses are all ignited bombs around unprotected innocents people in europe are buying guns at breakneck speed and the only one who forsaw this and put it into campaign is wait for it donald trump the rest are currently trying to weasel word their way out of their previous pc stance trump bet on it the only thing republican gope are trying to do is protect their corruption and unfortunately kaisch or hillary as president will do that for them they don give damm about the voters they say so every day they are terrified at the money it will cost them if trump is elected and idiots like you are all in favor of corrupt washington and no voice for the people	0
look at the rate this is going hillary is going to win in landslide because the gop candidates are cutting each other into ribbons rubio pro illegal legal immigration period that should really just disqualify him with any thinking american cruz had some issues on the h- visas but he has called for suspension since the abuses of the system have surfaced he is fairly strong on stopping illegal immigration he has made noise about letting the current illegals stay and receive some kind of legal status short of citizenship that is position don like now trump is becoming more and more loose cannon like some of him positions especially on illegal immigration but he is just blowing his mouth off with some questionable statements most just dumb still want to support him but we will see how it goes carson is going downhill especially him supporting tpp which killed me rand paul is the only other candidate that still might support except his immigration stance which is keeping me away he is good on keeping the terrorist out though the rest of the field are just the same gope bush christie kaisch santorum fiorina etc etc etc will just keep the status quo dem lite going and we can afford that we have to stop hillary clinton or the usa is over except if violent revolution breaks out	0
rubio is bald faced liar and will do the bidding of his open boarders puppetters as the gope requests he used many tea party folks to gain his position and now needs our helping hands to get him the hell outta washington and away from the levers of power he will never be elected potus along with the other rino elite jeb kaisch and christie	0
nixon was crook but he was crook for americans rather see him there than old hooker lips ted or freak show kaisch did you know his daddy was mail man ha	0
don believe this baloney that trump nomination would mean clinton in the wh next year the hildebeast is terrified of the idea of trump as an opponent and all these polls showing kaisch as the better opponent are hogwash	0
the base will scream if don does political deal with kaisch or rubio	0
really got good chuckle out of that comment only someone engaged in willing desire to suspend disbelief could reach such conclusion and as for morals and ethics how is it moral or ethical to once again choose someone that will bring us only more of the same which is what we would be doing if we choose cruz or kaisch	0
we ll see he may or he may not assume that there is chance of the happening while there is chance of it happening with cruz or kaisch for now going for the better odds trump	0
who is kaisch	0
how in the hell does fox news come up with kaisch as the only one ahead of clinton in the poles really clinton is not only weak she vulnerable it hilarious how fox sites some poll that no one has ever heard of except for them last heard trump is within to clinton	0
if trump and kaisch teamed up to try and stop cruz levin would have major hissy fit	0
oh yawn do you know that more of us have social liberal fiscal conservative views how many times do we need you to tell us that mitt was the one he two time loser mccain please yet here you are to dis non politician who is funding his own campaign who spent to win ny vs cruz and kaisch spending millions and the was his own money so please spare us your open letters and bullsheet	0
okay here is my open letter to anyone who wants to know why like trump first off yes in the trumps political views were democratic if you look at the views of democrats in the to republicans today not so far off so is it so out of line for him to change his mind about few things in that time yes reasonable secondly so far he has kept his word about everything he has said much better track record than cruz or kaisch now here is my thoughts cruz and kaisch are tied to big government and act as the performing monkeys all their tricks are for few treats nothing more trump is perfectionist he loves being the best he will do his best to be the best president the usa has ever seen he doesn have slick tongue he says what he means and means what he says we should all be aware of the fact that our crooked government is trying their best to stop him think of the people who hate trump clinton obama sanders jihad isis mexico oh and the gop that should not be speaking to you but screaming to you we want our politicians to be our voice not the governments trump stop children what that sound everybody look whats goin down	0
am truly disgusted to see this open letter posted on breitbart considering the alternative is ted cruz whom is traitor here is seconds ted cruz on the senator floor that tells you everything you need to know about that traitor we are saying no to globalism and open borders that means saying no to ted cruz and john kaisch	0
these folks looking for the perfect conservative with rigid right views are just deluding themselves and if we take that tack we will lose probably to worst president than obama hillary support conservative values but we must realize that it doesn matter unless we can get the presidency we can stick our chest out and say trump not the guy and ted cruz is look at this cycle as lessor of two evils scenario one very evil hillary and one not quite as evil trump so make your choice stick on your rigid principles and assure hillary is the next president or hold you nose and vote for the front runner of the gop unity will beat the left not this pie in the sky belief in the perfect conservative which doesn exist does bozell think kaisch is conservative don cruz has his issues to but these two guys aren winning so it doesn matter	0
think we are all leary of trumps conservatism and all however he is leaps better than obama hillary and rubio kaisch and bush have all shown clear rino character rubio and kaisch more so thanks for the tpp again marko	0
trump was monster from the start it not about calculated frank luntz wordplay it about emotion it like playing chess with the rock doesn matter if you re winning you ll end up smelling what he cooking eventually sadly the only other candidates left standing are religious dominionist cruz and wannabe kaisch who will lose ohio in an election your sacrificed christie your best chance at white house run	0

why ta hell would the koch brothers care about choice between cruz kaisch rubio bush trump or christie they are libertarian and believe in strong border security this seems like fishing attempt to make republicans have some infighting aka rand paul would be their guy oh the wqnted carly fiorna which is reasonable pick again sure lot of folks are anti trump but not sure why these two would be	0
none cruz will not win oh with kaisch still in fl is totally out of reach for cruz	0
they keep talking about splitting the kaisch vote see that more of block that may not vote	0
worse than little marco and that is really bad kookoo kaisch is even more convinced than lyin luzer that he is the one that is going to take contested concoction convention	0

the gop have options at play here and none of them involve cruz hope cruz kool-aid drinkers know that option is the gop will not go against the vote of the people and nominate trump and the party wont be destroyed option is the gop go against the vote of the people and nominate kaisch than the gop will implode and come the next elections in the voter turn out for gop candidates will the lowest in the history of the us and cost them both houses so keep voting cruz you only wasting your vote you are being played as cruz is only being used delegate mule so the gop can put in kaisch if they decide to do option	0
what gets me is all these clueless gop voters who back cruz get why you back kaisch hes likeable guy but cruz mean his voice alone is condescending than add in the fact he is sleezy lawyer and stretches the truth to make himself look right when its the exact opposite at least trump is real he speaks from his heart sometimes wish he would stop using twitter but he is one of us but again for the life of me can not understand why people like cruz	0
likely jeb rubio kaisch	0
so the key is to buck up now and destroy jeb marco kaisch huckabe	0
wait he thinks we need to get over illegal aliens hijacking citizenship through anchor births dividing people well yes kaisch we re being colonized by illegally present foreigners and birth tourists shows where your loyalties lie	0
would prefer you move to mexico kaisch take jeb with you	0
thanks to the crying baby butthurt biaches the nevertrumpers ted cruzidiots jeb romney kaisch and paul ryan judas rhino repubs these azzshats would rather have globalist wallstreet whore annie selling out her services for personal gain robbing us of our st and nd amendment rights dropping in millions of muslim and la raza illegal criminals in our backyards at grand pop blame these constitionalists posers for the decimation of our once great country hopefully one of their own or family gets an isis terrorist or tat faced gang member as their neighbor after their guns get taken away	0
he had chance for glorious moment and he chose the low road and revealed his lack of character he and kaisch are cut from the same soiled cloth	0
no they weren the only rinos were kaisch bush and rubio sorry that not true there were four donald trump was the fourth rino	0
the plan is for the establishment to get down to one rino candidate to combine all their votes for the primaries this is the only way the establishment can get back in this race they need to keep carson trump and cruz in the race to split the vote however they need to somehow peel off conservative and populist votes so they ll try to get carson cruz and trump to fight each other poll averages iowa trump cruz carson rubio christie kaisch bush new hampshire trump cruz carson kasich bush christie rubio south carolina trump carson cruz rubio bush	0

nikk is also the whore of rubio ryan gowdy kaisch	0
don forget paul ryan rubio kaisch whore	0
gotta love how many assumptions are going on here if you took that many with the other candidates thought module but this is an expose of how bad candidate rand paul is right now in his life precisely because he doesn understand commerce and the whole of the economy this isn an expose of the other bad candidates like rubio bush or kaisch good luck	0
ticked off fox won explain too what is there to hide know that kaisch doesn belong up there and that given why does he get the free ride look at him and see bush look at bush and see him no they don look like twins but they sure do act alike do the same with christie and rubio it quite unsettling to see it and would not advise others to do it it nauseating experience to say the least	0
well that would make donald having at least more than jebber the butt mittens kaisch rubio or any of the establishment	0
so looks like you better jump on the trump train so you don lose again guaranteed those same people won vote for jebber the hut or marco or fat boy or kaisch rolol so you gonna lose this next election for us	0
kaisch is missing from your list	0
marco cruz and kaisch have missed the point that the republican party is changing and they can accept the change or not but the party is changing period	0
still laughing at rubio cruz kaisch to large extent make your discourse politcally acceptable to the opposition so that is surrender on their part to leftist violence cruz and kaisch are scared of the big bad left way to go double thanks to those guys for standing up for us fellow conservatives hmmm none of the cruz bots showing their faces figures	0
this seals the deal for me wouldn vote for cruz rubio or kaisch if jesus himself appeared and ordered me to do it	0
kaisch intro song sould be am loser	0
roadtested roadtested please the only people wanting race war is the white house trump has threatened to do way more than cruz on this issue and now we have the bush-alike kasich pandering to the illegals by saying he will give them legal status within his first days do you not realize that there are in excess of million illegals in the country and more sliding in daily do you not understand the consequences of such an act if you legalize them and allow them to stay their prodigy become democrats or vote democrat this is the only reason obama and his slime have opened the floodgates and the gope sits idly by twiddling their fingers kaisch is dyed in the wool establishment guy who has supported and implemented big government programs in his own state if he was such force then explain why obama took ohio not once but twice kasich will pass but thanks for the offer	0
trump just got attacked in dayton--- and cruz kaisch have the nerve to take the side of the thugs	0
think the right also had hand in it cruz rubio and kaisch all had the same talking points in their response	0
trump should wipe the floor with rubio and kaisch vote against the establishment florida and ohio	0
then we have idiot republican candidates succumbing to the left as well it getting ridiculous cruz rubio are kaisch tools of the establishment	0
jeb and kaisch will throw all their voters to him so he ll now have less support than low fat milk	0
they don care where we go as long as their candidate either republican or democrat wins the party label is tool for them polite fiction the gope and the dnc maintain because its useful to fool the rubes when you look at actual policy there is very little difference between jeb hillery rubio biden obama kaisch and the rest when you wipe off the gloss they are all the same trump and sanders otoh are not part of the club and that is the difference	0
no its obvious you re cankles man you use her minion name for donald trump you need to man up and admit your allegiances kaisch is gone kaput finished no longer on the political scene never to return	0
that what walker is being paid to do and you can tell it kaisch is another one just this morning on the fox news he was asked why his position on birthright citizenship has done in essence he said just because watching trump just shows us how bought and paid for the other guys are	0
exactly walker huckabee kaisch christie paul santorum jindal and graham should simply go away they fought good fight but it time to move on	0
the end-game kaisch walker numbers will go to bush cruz carson huckabee will go to trump fiorina and rubio will split between trump and bush trump bush undecided	0
kaisch walker numbers will go to bush cruz carson huckabee will go to trump fiorina and rubio will split between trump and bush trump bush undecided	0
poll average trump carson bush cruz rubio fiorina walker huckabee kaisch where is the drop out line the rest are under and are irrelevant	0
we should work on throwing everything to kaisch if this continues see how the cruz guys like them apples	0
yet another red herring trump never said every muslim was terrorist so don know what kasich is talking about and neither does he which of those immigrating to the us is terrorist we have no idea because all methods used so far in making that determination have failed in fact because it wide open and you can just walk across no other method of examination can work duh if you don have way to bar the physical access of all people into the us and you don have means of determining which individual constitutes threat and which of that majority presumably do not then consequently you have no way of knowing which of those people regardless of claims who are probably not threat and which to bar so what method remains that would insure no more muslim cells make it into the west you have to stop everyone until such time as you do have method developed like until you have it figured out hello the reason trump is right on this is due to the fact that he has to continually make difficult high level decisions that have real world impact and so he is thinking about them in logical fashion consequently he has the best logical answer here temporary halt until we have something that is going to work reasonably well engineered queued up and ready to put in place then put that in place then test it then re-enable the process and refine it until we have it working correctly how difficult is that to understand so is it any wonder that the talking heads and the pols can figure it out nooooooooooooooooooooooo the leftist make their decision solely upon one criterion even though they lie about the reasons and that is does that objective advance their agenda of universal hegemony the liberal decides with the help of leftist manipulations based upon what is nice and what is mean the rino decides based upon the bleating of the herd hoping they can get stampede to the polls and whatever will keep they from getting whipped by the msm cat-o-tails no one in their right mind would think that the best way to find murderous theologically inspired whack job would be to let them in an area wait for them to start killing then catch them red-handed you only believe that if you assume it won be you or your kids that are sacrificed as bait and won even mention nuclear biological chemical based weapons kasich and the rest of these bafoons are simply trying to be nice in front of the press which has no more clue that they do and less responsibility ll think you bit more honest mr kaisch if you personally agree to to pickup all the bodies all the pieces put them all in bags dig the holes put the dripping bags in the holes cover them up and then explain to each and every mother and father why you help the killers into the country and why that was sooooo important that it was well worth loosing their children until you agree to do that stfu	0
you re half right establishment knows kaisch only won would be nh if you call that win they will be pivoting to either bush or rubio so you re right on the luntz focus group being slanted but ivdintbthink it will be kaisch	0
you got jeb and kaisch still don you	0
that would be kaisch trump got the highest poll numbers after debate does your bum hurt	0
so trump was rude not crime what is crime is jeb who has been out of politics for years will continue his brothers legacy--will get involved in syira keep the borders open enforce amnesty and work great with the democrats rubio the same policy trend kaisch leans liberal and will not close the border give amnesty to all who are in the us and likes obamacare to large extent cruz will increase visas likes the tpp trade bill and now not so much will have hell of time getting anything done if we have democratic congress all have thing in common they are bought and tremendously influenced by their donors foreign and domestic even though they say they re not we have the same old policies and politicians running and we will get the same results trump is the only one who has spoken consistently over years about the problems of illegal immigration and unfair trade we are living in this mess now so ll overlook rude and vote for guy who really wants to work for the american people since he doesn have skin on the game and putting up his own money	0
trump speaks from the heart he has been upset about how we are being ripped off since trump is for america and american citizens all the other candidates are new world order politicians hiding behind the constitution conservatism and the bible except for trump and carson they are all for open borders cheap labor and the destruction of american sovereignty btw trump has been registered republican since at least it seems everyone has their own definition of conservatism but if cruz is conservative sure don want to be one he is liar and has hired the most corrupt campaign manager and done nothing but dirty tricks all but carson have spent tens of millions of dollars running fraudulent anti-trump ads kaisch tries to sound all grown up but ran millions worth of anti-trump ads in iowa bush spent million alone on anti-trump ads in new hampshire all of the anti-trump ads are nothing but lies trump has all the candidates the gop and the main stream media including fox against him the only problem trump has the silent majority trump	0
donald trump is disgrace to america and the gop he is blocking rational debate on comprehensive immigration reform we need an establishment candidate like marco rubio jeb bush or john kaisch who actually understand that it is impractical and expensive to deport million people these million are hard working america loving christians who contribute to society these are my friends america is nation of immigrants stoptrump	0
the establishment rinos aren showing up to the rnc everyone that trump bad mouthed is boycotting the rnc----inc gov kaisch don think host gov has ever boycotted the rnc trump is party of one being puppeteered by newt	0
good people of wisconsin we are literally begging you to do the right thing and vote paul ryan out of office if your sympathy will not move you then regrettable as it may be perhaps we need to appeal to your sense of self preservation ohio thought it would be funny to flip-the-bird to the rest of the country by allowing the kaisch fiasco to unfold but they are paying for it now their economic comeback has sputtered and reversed in no small part to the underground nationwide boycott on all things ohio the same thing will happen to wisconsin if this historic opportunity to help right our ship is thrown away	0
cruz will never be in the he is being used as delegate mule the gope want kaisch so all the donors can get paid off with special deals that screw us over like allowing more jobs to mexico the new china	0
trump will get at least delegates in ny rather he get all but kaisch will win few as for cruz hes better off campaigning in iowa again he has better shot at the caucus than winning ny	0
everyone agrees that kaisch is much more establishment correct how many delegates did he get in co you know that the republican party would love nothing more than to nominate kaisch in the contested convention and according to rule kaisch would have to win number of states and colorado would have been one if kaisch does not have enough wins the rnc will be force to change the rules and create open convention in order to nominate kaisch which would literally destroy the gop overnight if the rnc and gop and establishment really were in control in co it would have utterly stupid to let cruz take them all maybe they are that stupid you need to take off the tin foil hat and use some logical thinking skills my theory may not be correct but makes hell of lot more sense than what you are saying again as said before still am ok with trump despite the attacks on me from his supporters just can stand echo chambers over here at breitbart	0
predicting cruz and trump in the final runoff know trump numbers can and they probably will drop but he has such high lead of the others that think he will remain the front runner carson is good guy but don think he will garnish enough support the main stream media shows cruz in the middle but think they re under estimating him fox is doing their damndest to keep their candidates alive bush walker christie kaisch and rubio but they also predicted romney would win ohio	0
trump pres cruz vp carson sec of state gowdy attorney general levin supreme court justice santorum labor perry va pound sand kaisch bush graham pataki gilmore	0
kaisch was about to cry please	0
kaisch needs to drop out he is worthless	0
kaisch needs to bow out for the love of god please	0
do think that there have been some very good republican presidential candidates this year br br really who the best of them kaisch just defunded planned parenthood in his home state jeb thought his brother did pretty good job cruz is an ambitious and dangerous tool in truth every republican candidate was and is terrible	0
correction first mulatto bastard isalmist president	0
they are beginning to do just that just look at the invasion by hordes of radical muslims europe disses the jews trades them for isalmist radicals since embracing post-christian culture it doubtful any of them have read genesis or would pay attention to it	0
europe is traditionally anti jews an anti israeli since the new- old independent state of israel they are crying give us back the good old days when we could hide our faults and unite the masses by blaming the unprotected jews and in addition rob kill and expel them those days unfortunately have gone the defending israel doesn accept anymore to undertake our blames for the our mistakes in all the events that we cannot deal with it is not fare- it is our habit- we were used to do this for years when we needed an unifying target for the crusaders we found successfully the defend less jews while on the way to constantinople the crusaders were busy looting and killing jews on their long way when we couldn find an explanation to the outbreak of the black death well we accused the jews that they had caused the disease by deliberately poisoning wells we massacred sores of jews across europe who cares that later the source has been found the disease stop and it had nothing to do with the jews when need scapegoats we always had the undefended jews when we needed to divert the masses focus from weak governments in algeria and morocco we had the good jews to massacre and destroy their communities when we didn want to disclose that high rank french spied for germany- we accused the jew officer dreyfus bloody emil zola- he destroyed the fun with letter accuse when we need to provide scapegoats for the social unrest across europe and later in the me we wrote the book the protocols of the elders of zion and we still circulate it to divert the focus from the real issues hollocoust you all know the me and all the worldwide nations are threaten by islamist isil and additional islamist organizations what can be better then blaming israel obama aid kerry requires israel to give up its security without getting get back one simple declaration recognize the jewish state israel and end of conflict claiming that this will solve me isalmist treat in case that the western states and the me leaders are still are using the jews for their goals-- the old days of the defend less jews used as scapegoats are over the israeli jews are not defending less and they have voice and the courage to unveil your old day behavior	0
hurry isalmist blow these cities up for they will protect you before while and after you have done it they call it sancturay the rest of us call it make yourself target so by all means let them bare the fruit they have planted	0

haha its funy because people died go trupm	0
anyone on the left who wants to accuse trupm of inciting violence had better take long hard look at the blm type groups that are the actual perpetrators of violent actions as they attempt to shut down trump rallies block roads spit shove and in some cases hit people who just want to attend those rallies am not trump supporter but its time to recognize where the real threat of violence comes from hint its not from the right	0
thanks for the reminder sack sucked beck scum nuff said ll work on real haiku for later trupm	0
coming by some of you afew days ago most said trupm cruz now you are attacking each other mainly on cruz	0

northern va voted him in with the help of the republican establishment the latter thought their own candidate too independent and refused to fund him so hillarite spy becomes gov va will go for hillary-that why mc ran we all hate his guts	0
have you ever known anyone who lived in one do and have and they are decent hard working people my dad was one who can afford their home usually quite nice and that plot of land they beautify with gardens flowers nice patio furniture--very community oriented--whatever you think about trailer parks actually now they are called communities they arent what you seem to think perhaps you should actually educate yourself about something before slamming and slurring hard working every day people who havent had voice in this country for the last years plus typical hillarite and cruzbot--so fricking superior--you know the truth you are laughable	0
and that is all we get from ignorant pos commenters like you flag this guy cruz or hillarite same mo got nothing to say but call names and lie	0

yep they want either rubio or the jebutante	1
rubio and the jebutante	1
jebutante takes pearl clutching to new levels of hysteria and that is his pink hello kitty purse for your information	1
oh those taste so blah so yeah they would be perfect for the little jebutante of the bush family blah lolly blah candidacy	1
she has been in this country for at least years and she can barely speak english the jebutante admitted they don speak english at all in their home	1
lucky for you swallowed my drink before saw your comment jebutante fits him to that is about his iq level	1
we don don need jebutante in the white house	1
think they are trying to cut their losses with the jebutante and are going to try to stick us with scrubio instead	1
you are still envious sparky envious of man who works hard to build something for himself and his family not cronies now jebutante would be the crony capitalist due to him owning and running an off shore hedge fund for his buddies investments	1
will always think of him as the bush family jebutante	1
guess she waiting to make her first appearance as jebutante	1
was done with them when they totally insulted and condescended about palin during an interview number of years ago jebutante is not fit to polish the bear scat off her boots	1
jebutante great descriptive term of the elitist jeb national political coming out party he just waltzes into the presidency wish had thought of that	1
there is nice little commercial dairy near where used to live years ago when the wind blew just right you could smell the cow manure that is the jebutante	1
man do ever despise this guy the jebutante really needs to pack it in and go home there is no way he will ever see the oval office except as lucky visitor haven felt so uplifted with hope during presidential election campaign since reagan am talking real hope not pr fantasy from obama how dare this snarky little spoiled brat insult us with his nonsense today	1
that is where the program weak point is employers have been getting away with lot for years now they may have hoisted themselves with their own overreaching this is probably why the cofc is fighting so hard for rubio and jebutante they know trump or cruz would kick them in the bahoogies with their american interests first policies	1
she might work for gs but their donor money goes to the jebutante that was explained months ago even temporary halt would work wonders	1
so you would rather have another dubya just rolling over and taking it in the shorts every time his opponents fire their missiles at him you must be from austin because you aren very texan at all if you would pay attention he is only responding he has not been attacking he also uses points that the opponent themselves have brought up he is the first candidate since reagan who is actually listening to the voters but he is getting the others to actually talk about the third rails would rather have self financed and honest man running than the soft spoken jebutante or the oily rubio those two are only interested in their own personal advantage and the interests of their puppet masters	1
makes you wonder if the jebutante also was the recipient of some lovely funds from them too after all the bush family has had longstanding relationship with the saudis for long while now	1
she is not an illegal sparky due to the fact they are married for her to be illegal would mean he would have to be an illegal too jebutante bush is the teddy kennedy of his family they are both family embarrassments	1
hard to be an asset when you stay in the shadows and won come out to play think jebutante was afraid the truth about his wife lack of assimilation after decades of living here would be exposed supposedly she can barely speak english and jebutante only speaks spanish in their home that titbit was directly from him by the way in an interview	1

yes because trump has already proved he is indeed ratings winner think it would be great if he held town hall now the only big problem as see it would be to prevent jebutante people from stacking the audience let actual voters in not bush supporters	1

think his tendency to retweet white supremacist and fascist propaganda is deliberate flirtation with neo-nazis rather than the series of simple accidents most of his supporters see it as history shows that nazis are only good at two things and trump has never shown much interest in building rockets however even if my worries about his nazi ties turn out to be overblown he has long history of trying to intimidate critics and of surrounding himself with sycophantic admirers america needs secretary of agriculture who can say chairman you are clueless about farming killing all the swallows and quadrupling crop density won work what we don need is an optimist who assures the don that everything will be great once we apply trumpist thought to water policy or whatever issue he thinks he understands that day	0

cruz is implying that voters has responded to trump without actually understanding trump positions primary voters voted for trump because he got free publicity by the networks cruz has had no free publicity one-on-one debate may change trump voters minds you trump commenters must realize that cruz delegate strategy was planned last year in order to beat an establishment candidate like jeb bush or whatever they re all gone now but the strategy is still in place in absence of trump all you trumpist would have voted for cruz rather than bush todd asked him question that no candidate should answer todd was trying simple set-up for trump commercial	0

if you are trump supporter don go there trump changes his views on things as often as prudent person changes his underware he trumpist so when your canidates stops changing his mind every few weeks then you can question my choices this why hillary or burnie will likely win far too many of you trump and cruz supporters have an over inflated view of your opinions and you pissed people off oh and to answer your questions get with question what canidate doesn support the same view as cruz	0
so the system is not rigged right trumpist	0
the problem is that trump policies as well as his inability to figure out different systems as evidenced by his colorado failure will cause even more unemployment charging americans more for foreign-made goods will only drive prices up while giving even more money to the washington elite it will also mean less demand for american products overseas as other countries will quickly close their markets to an arrogant insulting protectionist trumpist america all of which means disaster disaster disaster	0

breitbart has been relentlessly promoting trump look through their articles over the past few months and just glance at their headlines today it the trump show over here claiming that they ve just now become joke lost their objectivity is ridiculous sure they may have started giving little more love to carson and inflating his appeal and performance but they ve been at it for trump for far longer so forgive me for having little sympathy for trumpist feelings of betrayal the members of the conservative base who managed to avoid the donald kool-aid have been lamenting breitbart decline since trump announcement show breitbart quickly became ground zero for cuckservative stupidity and gope memes with zero regard for real policy they are now an empty rag except for their pretend outrage against establishment candidates who were tea party heroes before ann coulter published book and trump purloined her message to manipulate the angry	0

roses are red violets are blue deplorable trumpist how about you	0
of trump support is nearly perfect population size to marginalize as the ignorant bigots that they are in fairness its likely more decent republicans and those that haven gone full godless say this as an atheist who even find trumpist lack of christian morals offensive don go for wannabe dictators who are less qualified to be president than perhaps the average non-trumpkin gop er taken off the street this is since they have something crucial he lacks sense of shame remorse and humble reverence for the office of the presidency say nothing for the institutions that have guided this country for years of our history man with the dearth of qualifications as trump never before been so elevated to such height he be the first in our entire history to not only have no high level experience ex general us senator us congressman or governor but no high school experience either as wasn even on student council but hey what does it matter to have never been elected or serve so much as dogcatcher when running for the highest political office in the free world	0
as far as principles are concerned trump is trumpist nothing more nothing less as marketer carnival barker and reality tv host trump has found it convenient to appeal to the wave of disgust for the political elites sweeping through middle america by pretending to be conservative if trump succeeds in lying his way to the presidency you will find his loyalty to conservative principles thin gruel indeed	0
it wasn satire he read nasty email from trumpist and claimed he thought it represented most trump supporters the email was written by some lunatic nut job almost like it was from liberal trying to sound like what they want trump supporters to sound like hicks he never read one of the many tent preaching bible citing sinners all going to hell messages from cruzbot he knew darned well that email does not represent most trump supporters but he just went on and on pretending that it does just to appease cruzbots and bush lovers at our expense what trump supporter rubbed their face in cheetos on national television	0
well we need to understand that among people who are willing and will vote for trump are many we don agree with on different subjects personally invite to our trumpist tent all people we have to be concerned about the future of america	0

funny because my mother is american my father australian and was born in australia and yet have natural born american citizenship military service undergone countless security clearances and could run for president tomorrow you really need to learn the difference between hypothetical untested legal interpretations and those upheld by numerous courts including the supreme court chasing the birther argument to the political grave is an exercise in futility if you want to oppose cruz there are valid arguments- wall street connections tpp support etc- but the birther rant just makes you look like lunatic and considering we have two term president who offered up now proven falsified birth certificate and nothing happened you are seriously barking up the wrong political tree if you want others to support trump and trumpist	0
it wasn trump took money from goldman sachs and bush if you are never trumpist you have to recognize that cruz himself is voting for trump and that whatever you think of trump he is not rino and certainly not anything like ryan and other globalists and if you didn complain about romney or mccain you better recognize that trump is secretariat win better than hillary	0
not trumpist that is for sure	0
well that pretty dramatic let calm down with the treason stuff no one is committing treason and no one is insane it all very trumpist to get worked up about so unemployment is hovering around down from when the president took over that is pretty good can also attest to the fact when graduated in the job market was poor and now it not so massive unemployment is kind of red herring guess you could point to specific demographics and industries where that is true but overall we re doing pretty good obamacare needs to be fixed but so what- everyone having healthcare turned out to be good thing it lowered the burden on hospitals and it allows most americans to have health insurance we are concentrating now on crime rates that have fallen precipitously since the and still remain very low the attacks that have been committed by radicalized american citizens are tragic reinforcing the reasons we need to reach out and engage people thousands more coming seems to be stretch we ve had limited number of terrorist attacks that have been dwarfed by the number of people killed by gun violence in this country let not forget the amount of people killed by extremist whites with guns infinitely more worried about mentally unstable white people than muslims in sum obama has been an average president better than say carter or ford or bush worse than clinton or bush relax little man you ll die early at this rate	0
where is the article let in how this little hat is talking about suing trump when he andhis colleagues have yet to ever try to impeach obama over all the unconstitutional bull he pulled look sorry am not trumpist but this sudden testicle dropping that these gop hacks are having is starting to pissed me off especially when for years they have pretended they did not have any just like have no respect for men who slap women around don like gop leadership that is too fearful to fight democrat but will pick at someone on their own side you guys really needed to have checked these fools along time ago	0

rubio looking more and more suspect going to continue to support cruz but if comes to trump vs marco going to be trumpist mass immigration must be stopped	0
you are correct but if trumpagandist doesn reach that delegates he is required to get to win the nomination he will have to convince delegates to join him what are the odds that he will be able to convince anyone to join him now after his pyrrhic scorched earth strategy and when trumpagandist loses his minions are going to cry and blame the establishment when it will all be on him this photo that he posted of their wives is the deal breaker for me and the stupid trumpist comment further up	0

you and all the rest of the trumpist crowd are extensions of hateful man who is so insecure that he can even take any reflections about his dishonesty and hate mongering for you to say that sen cruz and his wife hate their children is the most despicable thing of many despicable comments put forth by the trumpists you are the most disgusting human being alive to say the things above but then again should not be surprised of the things coming from the obviously uneducated low class that are such ardent supporters of this fraud	0

if the dems steal it tuesday this is us year from now substitute trumpist for kurdish	0
hayward one of the major reasons for that personality-cult worship is that collectivism requires vast amounts of power to be invested in very small group of people with no significant restraint that very small group always devolves to single tyrannical figure because all forms of power sharing are seen as roadblocks to fulfilling the great leader vision and doing the urgent work of the people if the machinery of government moves too slowly for the great leader taste he has sacred duty to work around it for moment there thought was reading another hayward defense of dear donald the cult-of-personality billionaire who spent his career as donor to the collectivist losers in washington who can seem to get anything done but in all seriousness could see quite few giant gold-plated great donald statues in the years beyond trumpist administration	0

please realize won search back through your posts--those experiences are largely unique to you and your life you painted me for example with that broad brush when you labled me please note never mentioned trump in any way or identified myself as trumpist not word for word but think that is fair description of your accusation of me even if shared might not glean from them what it is you would hope would--i an extreme right winger suppose so why would that said the fact that talking to you at all implies some level of respect for you even though your view of humanity is pretty much opposed to mine suspect have had rule in recent years which have enforced upon myself to stop talking to the left wing nuts as suspect you have perhaps had yourself with regard to us here on the right do not presume to speak for everyone else on the right wing--i speak only for myself so please do take this in to consideration not fond of you at this moment but willing to listen to you which is perhaps move back to the center on my part we ll see over time	0

the illiterate of the st century will not be those who cannot read and write but those who cannot learn unlearn and relearn alvin toffler please at least take the trouble to inform yourself concerning the history of the ghetto and yellow star before you attempt to use them as guilt weapons and to feed your blind hate ihr produce scholarly articles based on verifiable historic facts and that particular article quotes directly from impeccably credentialed contemporary sources fantasy island episode style material catering for the majority who have totally forsaken all power of critical thought is typically what you will find in the establishment history books perhaps you are not aware that the ghetto is ancient jewish tradition dating to the first jewish self segregation in babylon and that in fact jewish rabbi pressured gentile governments to allow ghetto in order to cement levite power the ghetto being essentially levitical concept as consequence germany created their first jewish ghetto in in ancient alexandria the new york of its day and in medieval cairo and cordova the jewish quarters were established at the insistence of the rabbis intent on keeping their flock isolated from others in the jews of speyer petitioned the ruling german prince to set up ghetto the controversy of zion by relations between jew and gentile were so bad the lateran council not hitler issued an edict forbidding any jew to venture out of the ghetto without yellow ring jew badge sewn on his outer garment so that every gentile he met could beware them the cause and effect of course was to further cement levite power at jewish request ghetto law was enacted throughout portugal the erection of the ghetto walls in verona and mantua was for centuries celebrated annually by the jews there in festival of victory purim the controversy of zion with emancipation the ghetto disappeared its maintenance would too blatantly have shown that the rulers of jewry had no true intention of sharing in emancipation on an equal basis the jewish encyclopaedia recorded in its edition that in the whole civilized world there is now not single ghetto in the original meaning of the word the qualification is important because in many places and ways the jews continue the closed-community life though without the identifying walls and the law forbidding the sale of neighbour-land to gentiles without permission has not lapsed to give one instance illustrative to those who know the city in montreal an entire district east of the mountain has by such methods been made almost as solidly jewish as if it were ghetto the decline of the ghetto during the century of emancipation was blow to the main prop of talmudic power substitute had to be found unless the ghetto-spirit as distinct from the physical ghetto was to disintegrate altogether and one was found in zionism which is the new method devised to re-corral the communities there are many who desire greater control over jews by jews and who resent the dissolution of this control in russia where once ghetto made such control easy and absolute rabbi elmer berger only the intellectually blind can fail to note that the promotion of group life centered around ancient religious traditions and cultures is return to the ghetto there can be no glory in group of people striving to perpetuate ghetto life even cursory reading of history shows that the jew built his own ghettoes mr bernard brown zionism is the true revival of talmudic ghettoism as these two jewish authorities state it is designed to undo the work of emancipation to re-segregate the jews and to reimpose the creed of severance on them in full force the chauvinist appeal of conquest and empire in the middle east is being used to disguise this true meaning of the process the controversy of zion when the roman ghetto was destroyed at mussolini order in the early the jewish press as mr bernard brown records lamented the event in such words as these one of the most unique phenomena of jewish life in goluth is gone where but few months ago vibrant jewish life was pulsating there now remains few half-destroyed buildings as the last vestige of the quondam ghetto it has fallen victim to the fascist passion for beauty and under mussolini order the ghetto has been razed the implication of this is that the razing of the ghetto was fascism just as the original creation of ghettoes at jewish demand is presented as persecution by the zionist historians of today the controversy of zion the ghettoes of russia and poland were an essential and integral part of the talmudic organization and any attempt to abolish them would have been denounced as persecution in the twentieth century the masses have been misled to think of the ghetto as kind of concentration camp for jews set up by gentile persecutors the same operation on fact has been performed on the entire history of oppression in the west in the twentieth century all else has been drained away until what remains is presented solely as the jewish persecution the ghetto was not something inflicted on the jews by the gentiles it was the logical product of the talmudic law and derived directly from the experiment in babylon dr kastein describes the talmud as the home which the jews took everywhere with them however for physical life they also needed four walls and roof the talmud itself decreed that the gentiles were not neighbours and that jew might not sell landed property adjoining that of jew to gentile the express object of such provisions as these was the segregation of jews from others and their isolation in ghettoes the first ghetto was that which the babylonian rulers allowed the levites to set up in babylon the next was the jerusalem around which nehemiah backed by the persian king soldiers built new walls wherefrom he drove out all non-judahites from those models the european ghetto took its shape this institution is probably the most onerous part of the modern jew spiritual inheritance the ghetto friend the ghetto where all hopes at birth decay jews who never saw ghetto carry half-conscious memory of it within them like haunting fear yet it was essentially talmudist conception to which their ancestors surrendered it was the perfect means of corralling scattered congregation imprisoning people minds and wielding power over them the demand for ghetto often came from the talmudists that is to say outside poland where all jewish life of course was ghetto-life the modern suggestion that the ghetto signified inferiority is part of the legend of persecution which is chiefly meant to intimidate jews so that they shall always fear to venture outside the fold today myth of antisemitism is intended to produce the same effect on them the controversy of zion german zionist leaders requested as early as that the jews be required to wear the yellow star the zionists saw it not as an insult but as heroic gesture just like the ss wore the swastika in the director of the zionist movement in the third reich brought about the wearing of the yellow star by the jews against the wishes of both ring and goebbels it wasn until september that nasdap finally ordered jews to wear yellow stars	0

to execute executive legislative and judicial powers create north american passport pastor also called the current concept of sovereignty obsolete and said canadian and mexican citizens need to be reeducated to view themselves as north americans although ted cruz has stated that heidi was only involved with the task force as dissenting voice her own written words tell the truth in the last part of the task force report additional and dissenting views heidi cruz wrote pp support the task force report and its recommendations aimed at building safer and more prosperous north america economic prosperity and world safe from terrorism and other security threats are no doubt inextricably linked while governments play an invaluable role in both regards we must emphasize the imperative that economic investment be led and perpetuated by the private sector there is no force proven like the market for aligning incentives sourcing capital and producing results like financial markets and profit-making businesses this is simply necessary to sustain higher living standard for the poorest among us truly the measure of our success as such investment funds and financing mechanisms should be deemed attractive instruments by those committing the capital and should only be developed in conjunction with market participants now you know why despite his blustering against obama executive amnesty for millions of illegal aliens in this country on march ted cruz indicated he remains open to path to legal status for undocumented workers for more on the nau spp link link link the power players behind cruz stephen moore of heritage foundation club for growth wsj and now freedomworks fame was named as an original advisor to cruz moore and his cohort arthur laffer who is on the board of scholars of pro-constitutional convention american legislative exchange council alec both endorse the rand paul and ted cruz proposed evil value added tax vat and flat tax programs moore and laffer wrote that paul and cruz flat tax proposals were the best candidate tax plans in their article they are much more open about the fact that the paul and cruz tax plan does include vat point that paul and cruz never mention vat tax is particularly evil because of the hidden way the tax is applied which makes it difficult for the citizenry to understand how much they are being taxed the economic policy journal of november exposes this entire plan chad sweet is campaign chairman sweet is the co-founder of the security-focused chertoff group group he started with michael chertoff after serving as his chief of staff sweet is former investment advisor for goldman sachs the same company where cruz wife heidi is vice president remember michael chertoff he was the us secretary of homeland

donald rumsfeld victoria coates writes for council for national policy member erick erickson red state as well as the weekly standard old line neo-conservative establishment bureaucrats are cruz advisors coffee with kissinger one would think raphael cruz would inform his son about soviet agent kissinger but apparently that was not the case senator ted cruz uploaded this image to his official facebook page on january th of himself having coffee with henry kissinger with the tagline honored to share few moments with dr kissinger and hear his thoughts on the challenges facing our nation cruz undoubtedly would agree with kissinger on trade he says in the below video that he is for fast tracking trade agreements and supports obama doing same apparently cruz cares little about american jobs and even less about american sovereignty since running for president cruz has backed away from his support of obama trade agreements because he found out the american people do not want to lose more jobs and our american sovereignty this is called covering your ass four super pacs raise million for cruz keep the promise is the name shared by four super pacs which reportedly have already raised at
