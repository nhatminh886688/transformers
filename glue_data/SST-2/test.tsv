to make this circle jerk complete the gutless spineless complicit congress goes along with him of the time the last chance we had was getting someone that was interested in following the constitution when lyinryan gave his terms and conditions to become speaker of the house they should have told him to sit down right then but that would have to have meant they weren complicit with plans when they voted in the house there were only somewhere around rebublican members that didn vote for him ryan gave him everything wanted and threw in several millions more for good measure that why lyinryan now saying he supports mr trump is just another lie from ryan so it doesn hurt his current run for representative from his state mr ryan needs to spend about months in the confessional at his church	1

economy history of paul ryan attempts to dismantle social security by travis waldron jul pm credit share tweet that house budget committee chairman paul ryan r-wi supports the privatization of social security is well known ryan proposed trillion in cuts and the partial privatization of social security upon taking control of the budget committee in and he has constantly warned about the supposed doom facing the program if major reforms aren enacted immediately but ryan attempts to gut the most popular entitlement program in america go back quite few years as ryan lizza new yorker profile of the conservative hero makes clear ryan fight against social security has been ongoing since he pushed president george bush to privatize the program in under ryan initial version american workers would be able to invest about half of their payroll taxes which fund social security in private accounts as plan to reduce government debt it made no sense it simply took money from one part of the budget and spent it on private accounts at cost of two trillion dollars in transition expenses but as an ideological statement about the proper relationship between individuals and the federal government ryan plan was clear two weeks after bush inauguration ryan gave speech at cato asserting that social security was no longer the third rail of american politics he toured his district with powerpoint presentation and invited news crews to document how republicans could challenge democrats on sacrosanct policy issue and live to tell about it bush ultimately went with slightly less radical proposal that still failed in the senate and caused republicans massive losses in the mid-term elections but ryan undeterred told lizza that the failure of privatization was simply due to marketing not that the plan was unpopular what some might interpret as the failure of an unpopular idea ryan insisted was mostly communications problem the administration did bad job of selling it he told me bush had campaigned on national-security issues only to pitch social security reform after re lection and thud ryan said you ve got to prepare the country for these things you can just spring it on them after you win the lesson don let the engineers run the marketing department aided by the mainstream media spreading of the lie that social security is going bankrupt ryan has been able to thrust social security reform back onto the table and it was embraced during the primary by virtually every republican candidate what ryan and his republican colleagues continue to ignore however is how easy fixing social security would be if they weren so insistent on protecting the wealthiest americans from single tax increase by lifting the payroll tax cap that currently limits social security contributions to the first in income congress could ensure the program solvency for the next years longer than the program has been in existence to this point that wouldn fit ryan belief that the government doesn have role in helping protect the financial security of the american people but it would prevent millions of americans from losing the much of their retirement savings as they would have during the financial crisis had ryan plan to privatize social security become law tags paul ryan social security share tweet comment	0

alinsky style hit job just what newt gingrich is talking about forty years after his death saul alinsky the father of the community-organizing model that inspired both barack obama and hillary clinton is more politically relevant than ever leading conservatives attempt to tie the obama administration to alinsky radicalism with newt gingrich declaring that obama draws his understanding of america from saul alinsky radical left-wingers and people who don like the classical america for their part liberals have scrambled to minimize obama affinity for alinsky and to sand over alinsky sharp edges blogger at britain guardian newspaper claims that alinsky was merely what passes for left-wing radical in american politics agitating for better living conditions for the poor liberals have also largely ignored the fact that the subtitle of hillary clinton honors thesis at wellesley was an analysis of the alinsky model somewhere between gingrich exaggerations and the left whitewash of alinsky is an explanation of why so many followers of barack obama along with the president himself draw inspiration from long-dead radical born in alinsky was left-wing activist with streak of ruthless political realism after studying criminology at the university of chicago he went into union organizing and found it too tame his approach to social justice in the words of the washington post would come to rely instead on generating conflict to mobilize the dispossessed his first big conflict came in when he helped lead workers in cleaning up the back of the yards the festering slum area of the chicago meatpacking district that led to major grant from department-store heir marshall field iii whose generosity enabled alinsky to found the industrial areas foundation the nonprofit at which he invented community organizing this new approach was distinctive he deployed pickets to the homes of slumlords and used megaphones to hurl insults at them he dumped trash on the front step of local alderman to demand better garbage collection he flooded stockholder meetings with raucous protesters tactic occupy wall street is emulating and he tied up bank lines with people who exchanged loads of pennies for bills and vice versa he boasted that knowledge of his tactics often led to preemptive surrender by local officials or businesses he was able to abandon plans to flood department store with protesters who would order merchandise to be delivered that they had no intention of paying for he also never had protesters occupy every bathroom stall for hours at chicago hare airport in both cases the mere threat of such action won important concessions from his targets alinsky himself disdained the chaotic tactics of student radicals he eschewed violence in favor of planting radical seeds while students were rioting at the democratic convention former left-wing radical david horowitz recalls alinsky organizers were insinuating themselves into lyndon johnson war on poverty program and directing federal funds into their own organizations and causes his most enduring influence may have been to inspire the national education association to become political powerhouse sam lambert the executive secretary of the nea in when it hired alinsky as political trainer boasted that it would become political power second to no other special interest the nea delivered on that promise between and the number of teachers belonging to unions grew to million up from only alinsky didn live to see that or number of other fruits of his labors but just before his death in he synthesized the lessons he had learned into book called rules for radicals in which he urged radicals to make common cause with anyone to further their ends the book was even dedicated presumably tongue in cheek to lucifer the very first radical who rebelled against the establishment and did it so effectively that he at least won his own kingdom alinsky argued for moral relativism in fighting the establishment in war the end justifies almost any means the practical revolutionary will understand that in action one does not always enjoy the luxury of decision that is consistent both with one individual conscience and the good of mankind where did alinsky get this amorality clues can be found in playboy magazine interview he gave in just before his death in the closest thing to memoir alinsky left he told how he decided to do his never-completed doctoral dissertation in the on the al capone mob and to do it as an inside job he caught the eye of big ed stash the mob top executioner and convinced him he could be trusted as sort of mob mascot who would interpret its methods to the outside world he introduced me to frank nitti known as the enforcer capone number-two man alinsky told playboy nitti took me under his wing called him the professor and became his student nitti boys took me everywhere alinsky recalled that he learned hell of lot about the uses and abuses of power from the mob and that he applied that knowledge later on when was organizing the playboy interviewer asked didn you have any compunction about consorting with if not actually assisting murderers alinsky replied none at all since there was nothing could do to stop them from murdering was nonparticipating observer in their professional activities although joined their social life of food drink and women boy sure participated in that side of things it was heaven unlike the mob members he hung out with alinsky never coveted great wealth he was essentially thrill-seeker who admitted he was easily bored and always had to stir things up says lee stranahan who was blogger for the huffington post until last year when his research into alinsky-inspired groups soured him on the left his followers are even more ideological and relentless than he was alinsky tactics of intimidation are case in point his most oft-quoted rule is pick the target freeze it personalize it and polarize it one acts decisively only in the conviction that all the angels are on one side and all the devils on the other obama white house has honed that tactic to perfection in then communications director anita dunn sneered that fox news really is not news network at this point president obama himself has in the spirit of alinsky gone out of his way to lambaste fat-cat bankers and greedy health insurers the administration has shown they ll go after anybody or any organization that they think is standing in their way senate minority leader mitch mcconnell said in february speech you know the drill expose these folks to public view release the liberal thugs on them and then hope the public pressure or the unwanted attention scares them from supporting similar causes down the road what exactly are the connections between obama and saul alinsky thought in the year-old obama answered want ad from the calumet community religious conference run by alinsky chicago disciples obama was profoundly influenced by his years as community organizer in chicago even if he ultimately rejected alinsky disdain for electoral politics and like hillary clinton chose to work within the system obama embraced many of alinsky tactics and recently said his years as an organizer gave him the best education of his life wrote peter slevin of the washington post in that same year the new republic ryan lizza found obama still at home talking alinskian jargon about agitation and fondly recalling organizing workshops where he had learned alinsky concepts such as being predisposed to other people power in after obama returned to chicago from harvard law school he ran voter-registration drive for project vote an acorn affiliate set up by alinsky acolytes the purportedly non-partisan effort registered new voters and was integral to the election of carol moseley braun to the senate obama then moonlighted as top trainer for acorn obama even became acorn attorney in when he sued on its behalf to implement the motor voter law loose system of postcard voter registration that has proven to be bonanza for vote fraudsters in illinois later while on the board of the liberal woods fund obama saw to it that the group gave substantial grants to acorn his presidential campaign quietly hired acorn affiliates to handle get-out-the-vote efforts in ohio and pennsylvania improperly concealing their activities in federal election commission reports as being for staging and lighting obviously team obama was eager to distance itself from acorn reckless record in voter-registration-fraud scandals indeed since then acorn has gone into bankruptcy following the surfacing of undercover videos showing its employees offering advice on setting up whorehouse for underage illegal aliens obama campaign showcased many alinsky methods obama learned his lesson well david alinsky the son of saul alinsky wrote in the boston globe in the democratic national convention had all the elements of the perfectly organized event saul alinsky style barack obama training in chicago by the great community organizers is showing its effectiveness it is an amazingly powerful format and the method of my late father always works to get the message out and get the supporters on board in her new book on obama new york times reporter jodi kantor lifted bit of the curtain on his past she told the texas book festival the obamas often don mingle freely they often just stand behind the rope and reach out to shake hands but he sees jerry kellman his old community-organizing boss and he is so happy to see him he reaches across and pulls him in and obama says still organizing it was stunning moment and when kellman told me the story it had echoes of what valerie jarrett had told me once the senator still thinks of himself as community organizer think that plays into what will happen in the race you can expect that the obama campaign and allied groups will be filled with people deeply steeped in rules for radicals that is good reason for conservatives to spend time studying saul alinsky it also explains why liberals are so anxious to sugarcoat alinsky and soft-pedal his influence on team obama	0

behalf to implement the motor voter law loose system of postcard voter registration that has proven to be bonanza for vote fraudsters in illinois later while on the board of the liberal woods fund obama saw to it that the group gave substantial grants to acorn his presidential campaign quietly hired acorn affiliates to handle get-out-the-vote efforts in ohio and pennsylvania improperly concealing their activities in federal election commission reports as being for staging and lighting obviously team obama was eager to distance itself from acorn reckless record in voter-registration-fraud scandals indeed since then acorn has gone into bankruptcy following the surfacing of undercover videos showing its employees offering advice on setting up whorehouse for underage illegal aliens obama campaign showcased many alinsky methods obama learned his lesson well david alinsky the son of saul alinsky wrote in the boston globe in the democratic national convention had all the elements of the perfectly organized event saul alinsky style barack obama training in chicago by the great community organizers is showing its effectiveness it is an amazingly powerful format and the method of my late father always works to get the message out and get the supporters on board in her new book on obama new york times reporter jodi kantor lifted bit of the curtain on his past she told the texas book festival the obamas often don mingle freely they often just stand behind the rope and reach out to shake hands but he sees jerry kellman his old community-organizing boss and he is so happy to see him he reaches across and pulls him in and obama says still organizing it was stunning moment and when kellman told me the story it had echoes of what valerie jarrett had told me once the senator still thinks of himself as community organizer think that plays into what will happen in the race you can expect that the obama campaign and allied groups will be filled with people deeply steeped in rules for radicals that is good reason for conservatives to spend time studying saul alinsky it also explains why liberals are so anxious to sugarcoat alinsky and soft-pedal his influence on team obama	0

my thoughts exactly wonder if hitlilary used her position as head of the islamic state department to gather intel about her enemies or possible opposition for when she runs in maybe deal was made in secret as well with the hitlilary camp offering up something in return as well as promising not to destroy her or maybe warren is playing possum as well and waiting to see which way the wind blows after the hitlilary scandal number ve lost count she could be playing it safe so she doesn anger the hitlilary faction and is hoping this scandal takes her out so hitlilary won bear any grudges against her even if she does decide to run in the future the obama camp pulled on the long knives but what wast the purpose behind it all did obama want revenge or does he want to appoint his successor or did he show hitliary the long knife only to retract it for something in return love to be fly on the wall and seeing and hearing what is going on behind the scenes during this civil war within the democratic camp maybe camp obama decided to play thermonuclear war with camp hitlilary	0

yet another breitbart article showing how little they understand about reddit like the last article they conveniently fail to mention that the_donald was artificially causing their posts to reach the top of all which is part of the reason that the frontpage algorithm was changed the algorithm applies equally to all subreddits so the_donald is in no way being censored the title of this article even makes it seem like the actions of news are the actions of the website as whole as if the admins personally do anything in the individual sub hope that these omissions are just the result of ignorance on how the website works and not result of biased journalism but leaning towards the latter	0

the benefit for the site is an all page that as many users as possible will find interesting it bad business for reddit if people stop checking their site because all they see is threads dominated by one hyperactive group that they have no interest in the_donald being the subreddit that was dominating everything is incidental to whether or not it good idea but sure it was not incidental to the timing	0
the_donald community known for its commitment to free speech what hoot have been banned three separate times using three different accounts from this subreddit for voicing dissenting opinion if anything this subreddit is one of the most oppressive on reddit this article is load of horse pucky	0

let them change the algorithms this does more for trump than anyone at the_donald could possibly do on their own	0
the_donald is beating the reddit admins at their own game they can beat us with algorithms and censorship users and rising	0
the best dam place on the internet the_donald subreddit most based freedom loving individuals on the planet most days there is no place rather be	0
go make an account subscribe to the_donald upvote early and upvote often	0
that all good but we need to infiltrate their most popular spots and carve out our own areas just like we have at the_donald	0
the new algorithm is absolute censorship all of the_donald posts that would have hit the front page are now going straight to all controversial they might let one hit the front page but seeing as the_donald is so popular and all of the upvotes the posts in it get it is outright censorship under the guise of bringing more diversity to the front page zero the_donald posts are on the front page as of this post but of the top posts in all controversial are all from the_donald what that means is those posts should be on the front page but have been moved automatically so as to not offend the reddit hive-mind of leftist thinking or lack thereof we in the_donald will not be stopped and will continue to one of the top subreddits on the site no matter how they try to shut us up	0
yeah there are lot of other subs as well sub to xboxone and leathrcraft for example if you have an interest there is subreddit for it pretty cool forum to see more of the things you like am member of the_donald as well maga	0
was on reddit that day the conversations that took place on reddit when the ultra-liberal bernie people flooded into the the_donald were some of the most riveting that have ever read online usually the two groups just fling insults at each other but in this case the bernie people had to be polite and the donald people responded in kind lot of liberal gays were surprised to discover that christians were supportive of them as americans when the left wasn also saw many being introduced to milo real learning experience for everyone	0
of reddit is for entertainment and has nothing to do with politics whatsoever member of the_donald and there some dispute with some other subreddits but most of reddit is just place to share funny things you found on the internet	0
the writing was on the wall when news even banned posts that were asking people to donate blood for the orlando victims if you visited the front page of the internet the morning after the attack you have no idea the attack even occurred the_donald is the most active page on reddit if reddit doesn want that traffic it may be time for the_donald to set up shop elsewhere and let reddit become even more irrelevant	0
breitbart has no idea what they are talking about led to massive user exodus to the_donald community known for its commitment to free speech the sub-reddit is known for banning anyone that says anything even remotely critical of the orange baby man they make breitbart look uncensored by comparison	0
reddit is not all leftist the most active group on the whole site is the_donald it full trump and pretty funny love it	0
it just coincidence we re changing our algorithms to promote more diversity after the_donald dominates the front page we ve been planning this for some time now nothing to see here move along	0

the problem with milo the alt right are just joking theory is when he finishes work he socializes with white supremacists he close friends with guy who wants to deport all jews from american and when he gets home he goes on his private web chats where his friends are calling black people ggers whistleblower leaked his private webchats while ago and then he logs into his anonymous chan account on the white supremacy pages and posts racist stuff whistleblower leaked this while ago and then he logs on to twitter and has private chats with white nationalist who went on to be arrested for terrorism charges against jews this was leaked while ago he deleted the chats and then he goes onto the_donald and posts loads of offensive stuff about muslims just look at his account and then he logs on to twitter and posts offensive things about black people and jews oh yeah he got banned so you can look at this any more so his entire life is that of white supremacist both his public and private life but it just joke his entire public and private life is an elaborate prank find that hard to believe attempting to make racism and racist abuse and harassment socially acceptable is the goal of the alt-right suspect and the goal of milo	0

as many people already know the internet is an echo chamber the constraints of the medium too often don allow for meaningful discourse to occur while some may argue that it helps to democratize information and enables open dialogue it also drowns people in sea of unvetted material and encourages tribalism some forums do better than others with the former but all are susceptible to the latter br br one of the biggest issues with the_donald is that it bans all who dissent discourse even in severely limited form isn allowed while rightly criticizing the mainstream media for its shortcomings they reproduce those shortcomings and magnify them br br the new york times as an agenda-setting news organization has significant burden on it to be of the highest quality possible many times this newspaper has fallen short of the journalistic ideal that it seeks to uphold information put out by this organization is too often misleading and has clear bias it is right to be critical of things like the_donald but recent events should be taken as moment for deep reflection about how to improve journalistic integrity at home br br admittedly ignorant of the process by which the new york times vets its sources and its information but this process should be carefully gone over and improved recognize that in the new media landscape this burden of near perfection is not easy to reach but it is imperative now more than ever that the organization make that effort	0

cointel was the and is important in this context because it was systematic and illegal federal attempt to undermine and destroy black leadership intensified attention under this program should be afforded to the activities of groups such as the student non-violent coordinating committee the southern christian leadership conference revolutionary action movement deacons for defense and justice congress of racial equality and the nation of islam particular attention should be given to extremists who direct the activities such as stokely carmichael rap brown elijah mohammad and maxwell cointel-pro cointel-pro-black-extremists cointelpro-black-extremists-part- of view hoover the director of the fbi at the time specifically issued directives to expose disrupt misdirect discredit neutralize or otherwise eliminate the movements and their leaders including dr king this has lasting implications because well that was our leadership population of people without leadership is little more than mob and guess what this attempt to subvert and neutralize black leadership worked by nearly all influential black leaders were dead or in jail in no small part because of cointel pro read all the docs yourself if your cointel-pro cointel-pro-black-extremists	0

the cost of the indian vikrant was estimated at being between rs and crore years ago and may have increased since this is equivalent to to billion the total cost of the two qe class carriers was estimated as billion little over year ago however this includes significant fixed costs as well as the build cost of the ships if we wanted to build additional carriers to the same design the extra ones would cost less while the vikrant does have some advantages higher top speed better armament the queen elizabeth class does have advantages of its own physical size of the flight deck probably the hangar as well large aircraft lifts highly-automated ammunition handling integrated full-electric propulsion which allows more efficient use of internal volume presumably larger quantities of ammunition and aviation fuel as an inherent advantage of being larger also the f- is significant step beyond the mig- and the naval tejas so yes the qe and pow do cost more than the vikrant but we are getting more ship for that money but it important to note that over their entire lifetime the build cost will be dwarfed by the operating costs given that fact it makes sense to focus on building the biggest ship we can afford while using automation to reduce the crew needed to operate it thus minimizing operating costs would prefer it if qe and pow were conventional cat trap carriers but that boat sailed years ago when they were doing everything possible to trim the costs as it is they are so much better than the three invincibles we ve been operating since that find it difficult to criticize the navy think they ve done pretty good job with limited budget	0

it was so obvious from the outset that the dems would never allow him to win the nomination the absolute proof if anyone doubted this was when he didn put up any fight whatsoever once the leaked dnc emails showed that the system was rigged in hilbag favor the whole time what patsy hopefully his supporters will stay home and make it that much easier for trump in nov	1
nice poncho hilbag	1
the dems still pushing hilbag today are fully attached to the msm media heroin drip-line but many many dems are moving to become trumpocats or already have my neighbor is union pipe fitter pick up truck with more union stickers then you can shake stick at and he hates hillary and say his local is not voting for hillary at all they like what trump says and how he says it	1
true that was the case but then hilbag sucked so much her coronation almost didn come true but her munch-buddy debbie waterboard-slutz and her dunce super delegates nipped that in the bud	1
like bernie in the way like crazy old neighbor not president socialism is gay compared next to hillary stalin would be good choice though bernie campaigned like puss imo he should have took it to hilbag hard but his integrity the same integrity that has him only making year the poorest member of congress might need an upgrade to practicality he should have kicked her right in the nuts but he wore kid gloves think he is one of these goobers who likes being down and out the perpetual underdog it the liberal victim thing and it hasn served his campaign or his pocketbook very well	1

the honest and factual answer to your question are those people who genuinely care about the survival of america for future generations now before you get all goofy on me guy who voted for reagan in george bush in and ross perot in that last election was probably the only time in my life where believed my vote mattered it turned out of registered voters were motivated enough to get off their lazy ass and vote with me you see perot was advocating something that personally mattered to me our runaway national debt which had ballooned by under years of reagan bush and republican controlled us senate led by the likes of jack kemp and bob dole perot made us realize that republicans make democrats look like neophyte pikers when it comes to expanding government driving up the debt and wasting taxpayet money the gop theory was as long as you do it on credit the idiots who vote for them won know the difference they were right it turned out republicans didn care bit about maxing out the government credit card every registered republican do what the always do voted straight gop ticket without even thinking about who else was on the ballot that gave us southern conservative dixicrat bill clinton for president dixiecrat is synonym for republican-light hillary also belonged to the gop in college and heavily campaigned for barry goldwater so at the end of the day will take the sane and rational conservative hillary over the kooksticks running on the current gop ticket if you had any sense you would too	0
that flag is democrat flag raised by those that felt the north was interfering with their culture and deciding to try to break away from the union it was democrats running those slave states democrats turning their back on the union democrats willing to fight and die to keep their way of life life that included slavery it was republicans that turned the tide against slavery in the usa republicans that fought and died to defend the union and republicans that brought slavery to an end in this country democrats gave rise to the kkk to the dixicrat segregation now and forever banner and democrats that conceived implemented and defended jim crow and it was democrats that stood in the door to stop desegregation percentage wise more republicans than democrats voted for the civil rights and voting rights act and democrats opposed the th amendment so why is it so hard to get blacks or african americans or what ever to even consider voting for republican	0

paul krugman is right to blame the demogogic excesses of the trump campaign on the poisonous racism and misinformation that the right wing has been pumping out for years in fact it began earlier than dick nixon southern strategy remember in with the dixicrat campaign of strom thurmond and the post-wwii slogan of twenty years of treason how republicans and southern democrats tried to paint liberals as communists though it was an earlier brand of republicans who were isolationists and who prevented the from joining the league of nations post-wwii republicans were the kind of patriots who were always spoiling for fight with our presumed enemies and saw as treasonous any less aggressive stance nixon along with joe mccarthy was major figure in that smear campaign and eventually he reaped the benefits when he won the presidency in his disgrace led to the brief interlude of jimmy carter presidency but then it was back to the racism and anti-government rhetoric that worked so well for reagan who began his campaign in philadelphia mississippi racist nativist rhetoric has always been the ugly side of american populism as those who fear they will lose whatever status they have if the blacks and foreigners are treated fairly feel themselves backed into corner and lash out in one last desperate attempt to hold onto the old ways right after wwii and even before republicans were there to exploit their fears	0

as john stated below what the guy said you can copy and paste and insert it into their strategy that gave us mcain and romney they do get it which is why they pretend they care about it and use it to get they re weak establishment candidates in the general looking at those words now nearly brings on laughter	0
don sweat it bigd as john wrote below what they are talking about in the video all of the we understand the anger and can relate stuff is the exact same playbook that they used to foist mcain and romney on us it joke but it awesome because they really have no clue how to handle trump other than change few words around maybe period or comma here and there from their old play book	0
it funny the more the washington insiders like nr try to smear him the day after trump went over by the way what do you call conservative nr as you bashed trump for not being one would you call paul ryan conservative or mcain or is just rino who are conservative so explain your definition of conservative because both of them have ignored their voters every time they were put back in promising to fix the slow descent of america down the drain so explain to all these trump voters why trump is not conservative	0
rinos like john mccain and lindsey graham etc break that rule all the time then they cry like babies when someone like trump slams them back worse mcain lets other rinos fight the battle he started with trump what complete and total wimp worse again rinos don stop at breaking regan law they call their own gop voters crazy and wacko birds and trash the tea party and libertarians and then expect these same voters to vote for their rino candidate when the rino voters and rino establishment won support or vote for non-rino candidate the gop base if furious congress ran against obamacare and illegal amnesty and then funded both and gave obama every judge he wanted appointed without fight and passed net neutrality and tpp if the gop chooses bush rubio or walker as candidate will vote rd party voted for every bush in the past daddy and both sons mccain and romney and after the utter betrayal of the gop in the primaries using democrat voters to help the losing rino win will never vote for another rino bye bye gop	0
kasich is not conservative neither was jeb bush nor was mcain nor was george bush who was moderate none of these people were conservatives	0
but clinton has no chance of getting elected unless the republican nominee is someone even more absurd they saw what happened in when they pulled an unknown community organizer out of the blue to play the race card because mcain and palin would have won in landslide against their then front runner clinton it going to be either her or sanders and the last thing crony capitalist like trump wants is pure-blooded socialist	0
just the fact that puf post would not put trump in political but kept it in entertainment where it still is says it all comparing this to sarah palin sarah was on ticket she was not the ticket or the outcome would have been different because she would have chewed up obama unlike mcain she is an immigrant is she not she got the impact she did because andrew breitbart he was the brains trump is still in the in all polls which they are not even showing this week don be fooled this is their scare tactics	0

well was just here as you responded do not recall reading your comments before have no gripe do not usually post here have in recent days your responses take on the character of person who presumes shared assumptions ie usually of pc nature no offense when sometimes you find they are not shared you are know mildly outraged by other opinions feigning indignation in the contemporary approved manner of the political mainstream it appears that that is simply irrelevant to clear thinking people you then don seem to be able to employ logic to demonstrate the validity of your argument as it was lacking in truth so what action well what was the last action in similar circumstances like that what does your pope want you to do to stop these crimes it complex you might want to look into the fact that the syrian mass killers are created funded trained transported and given communication equipment by the forces currently in control of the west see sen john mcain meeting man who eats hearts or putin calls john kery liar to his face or jihadists video proves they launched chremical attack and so on his holiness seems to have more faith in democracy than me then maybe he is right public revulsion did stop the west organising the total slaughter of all christians in syria that and the russian missile carries moscow off the coast put on bake sale no why ask the world is this not church issue no it is not church issue the jihadists had been assembled by the us from all over the world including the uk as is noe accepted as your quote explains this kind of request is incredibly rare it is rare for western elites to be so out of control though they are even destroying aircraft over ukraine the pope is not calling for deaths warfare invasion pogroms blockades bombings etc he is calling out the western elites for their action it worked though prayer is the key hope that makes my perspective clearer christians don kill using others to do it that just wrong regards	0

do these republicans are popular but the establishment does not want them to rise because they won go along to get along or fit the establishment gop image all gop members do something sometimes which

story here first met john mccain in not around his presidential campaign at that time but around the subject of internet taxation and remember being in his senate office and talking with him about internet taxation and why that was bad idea and it struck me then that not only did he get it totally but he was very focused on innovation and this is one of the things that attracted me to him think he really understands that government can play role that motivates innovation and government can play role to kill innovation innovation is the life blood of this nation and technology innovation has been huge driver obviously not only of productivity but of jobs and wealth creation for people so he does understand it and think when young people get to know him he tremendously appealing to young

mcain is another loser that has been in politics way to long he needs to retire and travel back to vietnam and apologize for what the us did there he was hero	0

honestly think palin had little to do with mcain losing when the republican party chose the man who at the time was the most hated man in the party for his constant public attacks on bush to curry favor from the msm as their candidate you have to just accept that they thew that election intentionally wasn saying anything about palin other than she would have been the only positive point of an unpalatable ticket	0
well with obama biden and mcain palin sara palin would be by far the the best of the four unless your one of the dems who can understand that tina fey isn really sara palin	0
so mittens is dismayed by the choice in well at least he now knows how those of us who refused to hold our noses and vote for him in felt how can these idiots keep calling themselves conservative with straight face held my nose and voted for mcain in the hopes he would die and we could have gotten palin but withheld my vote in from rumney apparently like many did one bad candidate is fluke in row is obviously intentional	0

role that motivates innovation and government can play role to kill innovation innovation is the life blood of this nation and technology innovation has been huge driver obviously not only of

got word last night that paul ryan is looking to rebuke the super serial predator with more fervor experts now predicts the house is definitely in play the presidency and the senate is gonner for the gop gop strategists are now advising all republicans to move on without trump former mcain campaign manager steve schmidt is now saying hillary can possibly win as much as electoral votes my election house party is set and we will party all night thanks to trump touche	0

that the same story the establishment used for mcain and romney right	0
think one thing iowa showed is there are lot of republicans fired up unconcerned with political correctness recent election history has shown that candidate unable to consolidate and turn out the conservative vote will not win the general election there is no such thing as the perfect candidate but think cruz has earned the respect of many in the conservative movement mr trump is newcomer to the movement in my opinion needs to show that he not just telling conservatives what then want to hear the list of candidates that promise conservative principles in primary campaigns and suffer from dementia once they get the nomination is becoming common practice and needs to be avoided at all costs there is more than one good horse in this race and hope the conservative food fight will not lead to the nomination of another mcain romney	0
right right and john mcain and mitt romney were just so fun	0
we should all remember that lindsey was mcain choice for potus	0
trump wouldn hold her back the way mcain did he would tell her let it fly got you re back and actually mean it another one that would help with the conservative vote also	0

from the nyt unions lean democratic but donald trump gets members attention washington of all the voters who might be expected to resist the charms of donald trump the two million members of the service employees international union would most likely be near the top of the list from our advertisers the union which endorsed hillary clinton in november is widely regarded as one of the more progressive in the labor movement it skews female and racially diverse roughly the opposite of trump rally in other words but the union president mary kay henry acknowledged that mr trump holds appeal even for some of her members there is deep economic anxiety among our members and the people we re trying to organize that believe donald trump message is tapping into ms henry said in expressing her concern ms henry reflected different form of anxiety that is weighing on some union leaders and democratic operatives their fear that mr trump if not effectively countered may draw an unusually large number of union voters in possible general election matchup this could in turn bolster republicans in swing states like ohio pennsylvania michigan and wisconsin all of which president obama won twice the source of the attraction to mr trump say union members and leaders is manifold the candidate unapologetically populist positions on certain economic issues particularly trade frustration with the impotence of conventional politicians and above all sense that he rejects the norms of washington discourse they feel he the one guy who saying what on people minds thomas hanify the president of the indiana state firefighters union said of his rank and file mr hanify said that mr trump has so far dominated the firehouse chatter in his state while he allowed that his members tilt republican he estimated that most followed the lead of the union international leadership and supported mr obama in and ms henry and other labor leaders remain confident that they can keep their members in the fold by making case that the republicans economic agenda including mr trump runs counter to the interests of working people but they also see mr trump as posing particular risks anyone who talks about dividing people in the country as solution is threat to the country to democracy the economy and to working people and we take every one of those seriously said richard trumka the president of the presidential election the potential pairing of mr trump and union members could be helped along by sense that mr trump unlike more conventional republicans has historically enjoyed cordial relationship with labor on many of his real estate projects he has put his fair share into hiring union people said richard sabato the president of building and construction trades council in northern new jersey he done that in manhattan in new jersey but that is not always the case the owners of trump international hotel las vegas filed objections to recent vote by roughly of its workers to unionize and the national labor relations board has found merit to the claims that the hotel violated workers labor rights the trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment mr sabato said that his members who lean republican but in many cases voted for mr obama would march behind mr trump on the issue of illegal immigration even more important for many union members has been the issue of economic globalization mr trump has railed against the trans-pacific partnership the country trade deal the administration finished negotiating last year and he has bemoaned the administration failure to stand up to what he and many union members see as china mercantilist policies he has also fulminated against plans by the company that owns nabisco to shift some production to mexico love oreos he said will never eat them again and vowed to impose punishing tariff on imports of ford cars unless the company canceled billion investment in plants in that country we like that he does not support tpp that he has taken the position that there should be trade tariffs for company that moves jobs overseas said ryan leenders member of the international association of machinists in washington state mr leenders who estimated that one-quarter to one-third of his factory union workers were trump supporters said he voted for mr obama in and wrote in ron paul in reflecting the anti-establishment mood that has engulfed parts of the labor movement mr leenders said he believed that more than half of his union workers support senator bernie sanders while very few support mrs clinton despite the fact that the machinists union endorsed her last summer machinists spokesman said that at this point any estimates of support for candidate are more passing snapshot of popularity many union officials are grappling with similar dynamic including the teamsters whose members have teamsters for trump facebook page with more than likes john bulgaro the president of teamsters local in albany said that mr trump had generated excitement among his members but that lot of people like bernie sanders he cautioned that they would need to hear more about mr trump position on labor rights to be sure polling of union voters shows that mrs clinton remains broadly popular and would carry most sanders supporters in matchup against mr trump but the same polling suggests that mr trump could perform unusually well among these voters for republican nominee christopher shelton the president of the communications workers of america which endorsed mr sanders in december said that while polling of his members showed mr trump support lagging far behind support for mr sanders and mrs clinton it was higher than republican presidential candidates typically net despite mr trump appeal particularly among white working-class men longtime labor officials and political operatives point out that mr trump popularity before single primary vote has been cast is vastly different proposition than whether he would be able to retain that support in the fall in every election around this time there are stories suggesting that union members will defect oh white union men won vote for obama steve rosenthal former political director of the and progressive political organizer wrote in an email response to questions in the end mr rosenthal said union voters almost always end up voting overwhelmingly democratic in presidential elections white male union members favored mr obama in and john kerry in by roughly percentage points according to polling commissioned by the even as white men over all favored the republican candidate by large margin mr rosenthal said that unions have proved adept at building support among their members for democratic nominees who generally embrace their economic agenda and at undermining support for republicans in recent study of working-class voters in ohio and pennsylvania based on over interviews working america labor-affiliated group found genuine support for mr trump among democrats but matt morrison the group deputy director said that many trump supporters were receptive to information that suggested gap between the candidate words and deeds just delivering little bit of new information we could see that his brand takes hit mr morrison said referring to reports that mr trump may have used undocumented workers on some of his development projects other experts cautioned that even if mr trump were to retain substantial support among white male union members without college degrees that would not necessarily yield him an electoral advantage in november if he became the republican nominee the voters whom labor unions must typically work the hardest to turn out like younger voters and latinos are groups that will be highly motivated against mr trump said guy molyneux pollster who has surveyed union voters extensively over the years mr molyneux also said that many of the union voters attracted by mr trump were among the percent of union voters who already vote reliably republican still unlike most other republicans whose appeal to union voters rarely extends beyond cultural issues like gun rights mr trump economic pronouncements have greater potential to scramble the standard political calculus do think that trump is threat said mike lux progressive activist who is former labor official and veteran of president bill clinton administration if the democratic nominee is hillary and she mushy at all on the trade issue trump will take that issue and drive it and drive it and drive it	0

watched fox for few minutes this morning even they are getting ridiculous looking but it did occur to me that they would do themselves favor by not taping shows two days in advance since they are always saying how trump did the wrong thing or said the wrong thing and he was going to suffer but by the time the show is aired he is up another points makes them really look foolish the funniest one was poor larry sabato being interviewed by someone two days ago and he was saying how trump wasn leading in any battleground state and there was box next to him on split screen saying trump had just taking the lead in four battleground states now that really makes you look stupid larry	0
these people are american citizens with first amendment rights just like you and me mr sabato was legal immigrant and spoke of the opportunities he received here mr baio in my humble opinion had one of the best lines of the night when he said let make america america again	0
pretty bad journalism from hall who was not impartial and there to talk about the news or analyze the convention in an unbiased manner this is however what happens when the trump campaign choose this kind of speaker scott baio ernesto sabato jr who in the world are these people did anyone vet the amount of crazy stuff these two have said and done over the years and recently nobody knows if some of the speakers were there due to the campaign failure to showcase lineup of relevant and vetted speakers but in any case there so much you can expect from people like baio or sabato or some others in the lineup	0

obama even admitted it was lie lie of the year if you like your health care plan you can keep it it was catchy political pitch and chance to calm nerves about his dramatic and complicated plan to bring historic change to america health insurance system if you like your health care plan you can keep it president barack obama said many times of his landmark new law but the promise was impossible to keep so this fall as cancellation letters were going out to approximately million americans the public realized obama breezy assurances were wrong boiling down the complicated health care law to soundbite proved treacherous even for its promoter-in-chief obama and his team made matters worse suggesting they had been misunderstood all along the stunning political uproar led to this rare presidential apology for all of these reasons politifact has named if you like your health care plan you can keep it the lie of the year for readers in separate online poll overwhelmingly agreed with the choice politifact first announced its selection on cnn the lead with jake tapper for four of the past five years politifact lie of the year has revolved around the health care law which has been subject to more erroneous attacks than any other piece of legislation politifact has fact-checked obama ideas on health care were first offered as general outlines then grew into specific legislation over the course of his presidency yet obama never adjusted his rhetoric to give people more accurate sense of the law real-world repercussions even as fact-checkers flagged his statements as exaggerated at best instead he fought back against inaccurate attacks with his own oversimplifications which he repeated even as it became clear his promise was too sweeping the debate about the health care law rages on but friends and foes of obamacare have found one slice of common ground the president you can keep it claim has been real hit to his credibility the affordable care act tried to allow existing health plans to continue under complicated process called grandfathering which basically said insurance companies could keep selling plans if they followed certain rules the problem for insurers was that the obamacare rules were strict if the plans deviated even little they would lose their grandfathered status in practice that meant insurers canceled plans that didn meet new standards obama team seemed to understand that likelihood health and human services secretary kathleen sebelius announced the grandfathering rules in june and acknowledged that some plans would go away yet obama repeated if you like your health care plan you can keep it when seeking re-election last year in and again in politifact rated obama statement half true which means the statement is partially correct and partially wrong we noted that while the law took pains to leave some parts of the insurance market alone people were not guaranteed to keep insurance through thick and thin it was likely that some private insurers would continue to force people to switch plans and that trend might even accelerate in the final months of several critical elements of the health care law were being enacted and media attention was at its height made its debut on oct it didn take long for the media the public and obama own team to realize the website was technological mess freezing out customers and generally not working also on oct insurers started sending out cancellation letters for no one knows exactly how many people got notices because the health insurance market is largely private and highly fragmented analysts estimated the number at about million and potentially higher out of total insured population of about million that was less than percent but there was no shortage of powerful anecdotes about canceled coverage one example pbs newshour interviewed woman from washington who was supporter of the health care law and found her policy canceled new policies had significantly higher rates she told newshour that the only thing the new policy covered that her old one didn was maternity care and pediatric services and she was the chance of me having child at this age is zero so you know ask the president why do have to pay an additional year for maternity coverage that will never ever need asked deborah persico first they tried to shift blame to insurers fact nothing in obamacare forces people out of their health plans said valerie jarrett top adviser to obama on oct politifact rated her statement false the restrictions on grandfathering were part of the law and they were driving cancellations then they tried to change the subject it important to remember both before the aca was ever even gleam in anybody eye let alone passed into law that insurance companies were doing this all the time especially in the individual market because it was lightly regulated and the incentives were so skewed said white house press secretary jay carney but what really set everyone off was when obama tried to rewrite his slogan telling political supporters on nov now if you have or had one of these plans before the affordable care act came into law and you really liked that plan what we said was you can keep it if it hasn changed since the law passed pants on fire politifact counted times when he included no caveats such as high-profile speech to the american medical association in if you like your health care plan you ll be able to keep your health care plan period no one will take it away no matter what even obama staunchest allies cried foul on nov columnist clarence page of the chicago tribune wrote that the public was entitled to hear the unvarnished truth not spin from their president about what they were about to face don feel good about calling out obama whopper because support most of his policies and programs but in this instance he would have to be delusional to think he was telling the truth the next day obama apologized during lengthy interview with nbc news chuck todd we weren as clear as we needed to be in terms of the changes that were taking place and want to do everything we can to make sure that people are finding themselves in good position better position than they were before this law happened and am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me he said the reaction from conservative talk shows was withering on nov sean hannity put obama statements up there with president richard nixon am not crook and president bill clinton did not have sexual relations with that woman on the liberal network msnbc joy-ann reid said the obama administration intention was to fight off attacks like the ones that scuttled clinton health proposals in the early that why the administration boiled it down to that if you like your health care you can keep it big mistake but it was mistake that think came little bit out of the lesson of the clinton years she said nov two days later house minority leader nancy pelosi defended obama statement as accurate and blamed insurance companies did ever tell my constituents that if they like their plan they could keep it would have if ever met anybody who liked his or her plan but that was not my experience she said obama offered an administrative fix that same day allowing state insurance commissioners to extend current plans but only some have chosen to do so in announcing the fix obama again conceded he had exaggerated there is no doubt that the way put that forward unequivocally ended up not being accurate he said it was not because of my intention not to deliver on that commitment and that promise we put grandfather clause into the law but it was insufficient it is too soon to say what the lasting impact of if you like your health care plan you can keep it will be the president favorability ratings have tumbled in recent weeks pew research usa today poll conducted dec found the percentage of people viewing obama as not trustworthy has risen points over the course of the year from percent to percent much depends on the law continuing implementation and other events during obama final three years in office said larry sabato political scientist who runs the center for politics at the university of virginia still obama has work to do to win back public trust sabato said whole series of presidents developed credibility gaps because people didn trust what they were saying anymore and that obama real problem he said once you lose the trust of substantial part of the american public how do you get it back	0

did you not read the article trump is losing in the national polls of course trump still faces daunting challenge his single-minded nevertrump detractors have spent million in the last three months to tear him down and that big reason why he points down against hillary clinton in the latest cnn poll and larry sabato of the university of virginia probably liberal in his heart of hearts but still fair-minded enough has released an electoral college map showing trump losing to to put those numbers in perspective sabato projection would put trump in somewhere between the totals of john mccain in and mitt romney in both losers and of course after saying all thru the primaries that trump was immune to the negative attacks now they are blaming nevertrump detractors have spent million for trumps miserable poll readings cruz supporters have been warning for months about donald disaster in the general election it is not the nevertrump detractors that is the problem it is donald trump as candidate will not vote for hillary and will not vote for trump will find someone else to support will never give anyone my support who supports the murder of children never get that others think ll vote for the lesser of two evils but reject that won put my stamp of approval on evil either of them hillary is evil trump is evil will maintain my principles and will bow before my god and him alone won bow to the idea that somehow supporting lesser evil is helping my country principles matter	0
someone already wrote the comment but do remember sabato making list of the likeliest nominee for the republican party maybe it wasn him think it was but he had trump way down the list he even said that kasich was more of serious candidate than trump think this was after two or three months of trump being on top of the the polls and attracting massive crowds to his rallies after packed stadium in an august rally in alabama that should have been enough to make trump the front runner by every expert instead of saying trump is the favorite to win the nomination until he proves he isn we were being told to believe that he will implode until he doesn	0

unfortunately for trump it not about the national average it all about the battleground states let assume trump wins the states that have gone republican in each of the past four elections and clinton wins the states that have gone democratic in each of the past six put the reliably red states in trump column and reliably blue in clinton she starts off with electoral votes to for trump that leaves potential battleground states florida north carolina virginia new hampshire ohio iowa indiana colorado nevada new mexico with total of electoral votes trump practically has to sweep those states to win but clinton could lose every one of those states except florida and still win the presidency or she could merely win virginia where she is heavily favored and ohio where she narrowly leads in other words she has multiple paths trump doesn demographics pose another hurdle to the republican nominee path to and trump has done little to help himself by broadening his appeal trump is on track to win an even smaller share of the hispanic vote than the percent mitt romney received nationally in that poor showing helped deliver states such as florida nevada and colorado to president barack obama who won re-election with electoral votes to romney polls likewise show trump with single-digit support among african-american voters even matching romney percent share of white voters could be stretch given that polls consistently show trump struggling to win over college-educated white voters who make up about one-third of the electorate and women in general the fox news national poll released this week showed trump leading among white voters by percentage points and among white women by two percentage points in romney narrowly lost to obama after winning white voters by percentage points and winning white women by percentage points you keep hearing this explanation from their team that he is going to run up the score with white male voters and white voters in general said political scientist larry sabato no he going to run up the score with white voters without college education yeah agree he may set record there but he losing badly in loads of other categories the weirdest presidential election in modern history will probably keep us laughing cringingand shaking our heads constantly over the next two months but as former obama adviser david plouffe recently noted the big picture clearly favors clinton each day of this campaign seems big and interesting and crazy but ultimately least suspenseful race since plouffe tweeted referring to ronald reagan vs walter mondale to forest and trees situation miami herald	0

well than maybe you should have worded it as rapeublican senators which still isn right because ve yet to see any evidence of what she is accusing him of if there is actual real evidence that he did it he needs to face charges and automatically be disqualified from ever being on the supreme court not even fan of the guy but big fan of our constitution and the legal presumption that people are innocent until proven guilty in court of law not in the court of social media and popular opinion	1
holy christ you have got to be kidding me that is more unethical than the straight up lobbying and super pacs on the rapeublican side this line of reasoning is how we demonized hillary in the first place are people supposed to do nothing while the gop breaks every ethics rule ever and steamrolls it own country	1
can you imagine rapeublican senators calling for fellow comrade to resign over literally anything	1
gt you expect avenatti to show his full hand to these rapeublican assholes after the number of times they ve acted in bad faith	1
er sorry rapeublican is probably more accurate term	1
rapeublican is tasteless and stupid in the same way that demoncrat is think it does neither side any good to talk like that	1
that right ironically an old white rapeublican connection to an old white democrat just pushed this delay through where head on attacks and alienation were hitting the wall	1
flake is typical rapeublican who lives up to his own name all the time it the arizona special pretend to care then vote to fuck over the country with the rest of their radical right wing extremist colleagues	1
bernie directed by hideo kojima sanders	0
which is what hideo kojima was getting at with the plot of metal gear solid sons of liberty	0
war has changed it no longer about nations ideologies or ethnicity it an endless series of proxy battles fought by mercenaries and machines war and its consumption of life has become well-oiled machine war has changed the age of deterrence has become the age of control all in the name of averting catastrophe from weapons of mass destruction and he who controls the battlefield controls history war has changed when the battlefield is under total control war becomes routine hideo kojima metal gear solid first lines	0
man this is the kind of thing that makes me really consider whether hideo kojima can see the future	0
hell with all the zero-consequence groping insane plot reveals and cavalier discussions of nukes can honestly believe hideo kojima is writing our reality	0
reference to little known work by hideo kojima and has nothing to do with current or past american politics outside the work	0
humans are not rational at least not all the time and the economy reflects that to use an example that is more at home here on reddit was it rational for konami to essentially cut its videogame sector which was still turning substantial profit and fire one of the most well known and beloved developers there no but they did it anyway because of petty dispute between the owner of konami and hideo kojima no economist could have predicted that shit happening because it is completely irrational yet it occurred sadly things like that occur everyday in many other markets	0
it was our apathy after the sameness of the obama years that we only changed toward the propaganda for both sides now we can tell truth from context nor be able to tell the people they are wrong rather than right politics are team sport and we now live in the world of the fake propaganda and limited context view world that hideo kojima predicted on metal gear solid	0
personally like to imagine what hideo kojima presidency would look like	0
hideo kojima what the actual fuck	0
this is man who called one of the oldest enemies of the united states to hack and undermine his political rivals and led deluded authoritarian chants of lock her up in true putinian fashion	0
wonder if wapo nyt have champagne cooled ready to pop when they get confirmation that they ve taken down the putinian stooge	0
no no no we are in year as we now go by the putinian calendar each year begins on his birthday	0
translation from putinian	0
putinian lies	0
could if was able to imagine life in putinian russia	0
in no way am making an equivalence because if these allegations are true trump is putinian candidate that needs to be tried for treason just adding historical context	0
or putinian	0
in other words our so-called justice system is bullshit and people are too stupid to even vote out the gop let alone put their heads on spikes which is why we are fucked and doomed to become putinian plutocracy	0
libtards like you have brought up the conservative heritage foundation plan for healthcare in the past as the cornerstone for obamascare what you libtards keep ignoring is that the republicans never bothered to push that plan because they knew it would not work and that it would bankrupt the nation you libtards also bring up what you call romneycare while ignoring that romney only roll was as governor he signed it at the same time ignoring the fact that it was the dingorat controlled state legislature which wrote it	0
but over the first five years of the obama administration after-tax personal income was flat that performance was the worst term of any president since the great depression but keep hearing from obutthead that we are doing better than ever and every libretard that comments on these posts and on tv says that we have never been better too hhhhmmmmm just more lies	1
let say he even said this at one time or another which believe after researching all of the candidates never happened in recent years there has been no talk except for isis refugees the economy and health care trump wants nothing more than to fix these problems and yes he has an agenda as do all of them his agenda is to fix these problems because if no one does he will most likely lose what he has built why would anyone want to lose that don these last few years so many have lost so much he will fix that and if you ask any female they change their minds several times minute if trump said something years ago but has different opinion now so what they all do it do it everyone changes their minds especially after more years alive learning more things could go on and on if this doesn explain alot then you have the brain of libretard pea rock	1
not really republitard but also not libretard weird thing is liberals already have ton of muslim targeting databases under obama so don know why everyone is crapping their pants all of sudden	1
funny thing is while was questioning every single libretard on the atlantic liberal news source that sometime does good investigative work but kept propagating lies about trump of the liberals on their site approve of killing us citizens who are muslims without even looking into the evidence because obama said that it was ok to do so they follow and kiss obama azz without questioning him and treating his words as if he god himself they only care about others like muslims when it serves their fascist agenda vote for trump the only true hero left who is not connected to anyone within the establishment	1
this massive untapped voting block is much more likely to be progressive because per cent of us in the uk have masters degrees in libretard indoctrination	1
and what party has for generations stonewalled mortgage regulation ran fannie mae and freddie mac and caused the great depression that we currently in that would be demorats and what party stonewalled and prevented an overhaul of banking regulations which again resulted in the collapse of savings and loan organizations and small banks again that would be demorats sorry libretard clowns the paper trail is way too strong for you to continue to lie and blame anyone else you elected demorats you reelected demorats you are to blame	1
blockquote you are an idiot all by yourself get over it stupid people like yourself shouldn be allowed to breed everyone on here keeps proving you are wrong you keep asking for proof they keep giving it to you what do you not understand and you have nothing going to go out on ledge and say you are libretard because you sure sound like one blockquote so cute what great argument for birth control you are btw the spelling is libtard if you re going to be childish douche at least learn to spell your slurs correctly enjoy your ignorance	1
because they are large contributors of the libretard or turd party so they think they have the right more than the rest of the people to speak ill of the gop when they should be speaking ill of themselves for being so inadequate to do anything of value in the world	1
how to piss off stupid libretard in seconds don recycle my kids do not wear helmets drive tundra just throw out all my garbage into the recycled bin let al gore sort it out	1
wow that dude is in river in egypt called de nial or he just another libretard puke trying to hold on to power like obalo in the us either way those of us with full brain need to keep on fighting them	1
won be going to the king of prussia mall between now and christmas besides being soft target it is owned by libretard won put myself or my family in danger and won patronize an obama suck it simon property check to see who owns your mall	1
libretard logic at work here	1
this is exactly why we need loser pays legislation for lawsuit reform it not that expensive to get laughed out of court when you have libretard lawyers behind you it is expensive when you have to pay for this bs	1
insecure those libretard women	1
and suppose you think hitlery is innocent and hasn done anything wrong since she has been in politics is that right dumb ass libretard because of people like you this country and world are doomed	1
what are you talking about you are complete jackass you must be libretard cause you sure sound like one	1
you can even spell let alone make coherent point you poor sad little libretard	1
and the libretard media will undoubtedly cover this and lie slander and defame but of course keeping things very low intellect and not using big words so that you libretards can kind of understand of course you libretards and your mentally challenged media friends will and would scream and whine if dirty christian dared to have any event in short liberals are just waste of skin and without any worth at all except as doorstop or an organ donor	1
of course bush whenever libretard is confronted with facts they cringe just like vampire when someone flashes cross at them then they lie and just invent bs to cover their lying incompetence and ignorance	1
oh heavens wait ohhhh liberal and muslim ideals no not general bus that of course would only offend we must have muslim or nondescript silly ass bus loaded with drugs and libretard and muslim propoganda that is the only fair way to go	1
no she is advocating the right of freedom of speech and she refuses to bow to filthy gutter cult like liberalism and islam realize that you are libretard but try and keep up	1

erickson is racist bigot rino what else is there to say his past comments prove it and someone who makes the vile statements he has should be disinvited from the panorama of personalities trying to inform influence our views there is no room on the stage for someone who is trying to manipulate the process with his vile disturbing megalomania that allows him to feel that his opinion is more valid than that of the voting masses and disinvite the leading candidate in the polls who the does this little turdweasle think he is kingmaker relegate this idiot to the woodshed where he belongs along with his huggie plush jebush doll rush should never let him guest host again anybody clever enough to see what did there	0
yes my darling shiori assumed female you are correct but mr obola flatfooted the byways of chicago slums for few years communistically organizing the zombie voters and has adopted the mannerisms and walking style of huggie bear and fancies himself the ultimate leader of the ghetto strong this is why my argument is reasonable obola sees himself smooth and fly but will bend like pasta when the heat is really on	0
many of the venezuelans now complaining about hunger violence and deprivation are the same useful idiots who helped vote huggie chavez and the socialistas into power by wide margins at the turn of the century now that they ve apparently run out of other people money their mismanaged economy and endemic corruption at all levels of bolivarian government has them outraged outraged they say ah well better to see the light late than not at all hopefully they ve learned lesson that will endure through the ages	0

omg wow women day in us alone are killed and some by transgender women and girls lol lets take look at the facts--from reasonably gay no one has been killed for being transgender so far this year chad felix greene june myth and reality comments facebooktwittergoogle pinterestreddittumblremailshare as is becoming their tradition the lgbt media voices are once again counting down every trans person murdered this year as they did in the previous year the list is merely compiled into collection with no context other than transgender giving the impression that being transgender is dangerous this is used as evidence of anti-trans violence and built into the overall narrative of anti-lgbt sentiment this year in particular has been useful considering their non-stop screeching over anti-lgbt or anti-trans laws that simply do not exist the following are detailed from the advocate these are the trans people killed in mercedes successful this young man was drag queen and well known in his community he was shot dressed as man in parking lot with no motive his friends report he was beginning transition but no further details are provided the article is more concerned that he was unnecessarily reported to be dressed as man when killed and the police used male pronouns tyreece reecey walker this man may or may not have been transgender as he used male pronouns he was attempting to sexually assault year old boy in an apartment when the boy stabbed him to death keyonna blakeney keyonna was found dead in hotel room while engaging in prostitution according to police he was also arrested for sexually assaulting year old boy previously no motive determined shante issac shante was killed with friend while attempting to protect that friend from an assault the friend was shot to death and shante was beaten to death no motive indicated quartney davia dawsonn-yochum quartney was shot by an ex-boyfriend in an argument kedarie kandicee johnson this young man identified as both transgender and gender-fluid he was shot in an alley with no apparent motive demarkis stansberry demakis is transman he was shot by year old man that knew the victim and stopped by to pick up dj equipment an argument ensued and the shooter claimed to have accidentally shot the victim maya young maya was found stabbed and was rushed to the hospital where he died no motive has been determined veronica banks cano mid- veronica was found dead fully clothed in bathtub at hotel no motive determined kayden clarke kayden is tranman she was shot by two police officers after violently lunging at them with large knife they were called in because kayden was suspected of attempting suicide jasmine sierra was found dead in either his own home or neighbors and showed signs of possible homicide no motive was determined monica loera monica was killed by man he knew and who had been in his apartment earlier the man came back to pick up something he forgot monica was nervous about his as someone you don want to mess with and was killed in an altercation when answering the door according the the roommate present at the time the killer joncasey rowell was charged with murder amos beede amos is transman and was homeless at the time of his murder he was killed in homeless encampment no motivate he been determined as detailed from the list circulating in no one was killed for being transgender they were merely people identified as transgender who were killed as you can see this year is no different the motives are unknown and often times the victim and killer know each other the basis for anti-trans murder is that the transgender person is either killed once discovered to be transgender or because they are transgender the truth is however except for the killing of papi edwards in this has not been the case papi lured straight year old man to hotel for sex with another gay male friend dressed as woman papi lied about his gender to get the young man there and then told him tranny when they met the man angrily left and then came back and fatally shot him papi identified as gay man and performed drag most of the time the remaining victims from last year and everyone so far this year have simply been considered transgender and were killed there is no actual connection between the two	0
there is no such thing as transwoman transman transmom or transdad there are two types of human beings male and female being one who thinks they are the other is not type of person it is gender dysphoria and is serious mental illness with no known effective treatments feel sorry for these children and the hardship they will be forced to deal with having mentally disturbed parents	0
omg gay transman what in god name is that they need to add third restroom for those of you that have no idea what the hell you are that would settle it and keep you confused people out of the traditional restroom this is out of control	0
so all women need to expose themselves to the risk of some guy who wants to get off using the women room you do realize our nation was founded in manner so that the minority cannot be discriminated by majority and still have say our nation also has laws saying innocent until proven guilty by making laws like this you are punishing me for something have never done something could never do as it is against my nature if it were up to me they would not document rapists and pediophiles they would get mandatory life sentences on the first offense people like them do not change that has been shown again and again however bills like this will not work as you cannot enforce them and secondly you will be punishing people who have done nothing wrong but want to pee lastly your wife will have to use the restroom with transmen who you would call women by your narrow logic there is picture of one named buck angel he is gay transman and is more of man than ever could have been perceived as	0
ok you don even know what trans man is trans man sometimes trans-man or transman is transgender person who was assigned female at birth but whose gender identity is that of man google trans man click on images maybe pictures will help	0
overall thought the video was pretty good they could have used transman in there too	0
the facts don support you at all if heterosexual male wants to go into woman bathroom with the explicit intent of raping female do you really believe law is going to prevent them do you suppose they could dress as female today on the other hand transman under the north carolina ordinance would be forced into going into woman bathroom this is not something that typically happens today	0
what happens when transman woman who now appears male goes into woman bathroom under the north carolina law mayhem trump is right on this before all the focus on this issue transwomen went into women bathrooms and transmen went into men bathrooms and no-one noticed	0
yeah those poor white people felt uncomfortable having to eat next to those uppity black people why don those black people just have the decency to go eat somewhere else tell me where does the responsible transman go when he is in public and has to take dump you tell us you don want people who look like women but secretly have penises in woman restroom because your wives and daughters would freak out but unless you expect them to take dump on tne floor you are suggesting that people who actually appear to have penis go to the bathroom and then you suggest that real man might freak out and assault transman first real men aren afraid of how other people choose to live and represent themselves real man doesn assault others who are merely going about their business more importantly if your real men are incapable of not assaulting someone whom they feel might have vagina in restroom then what do you think they would do when someone who actually looked like they had vagina was in there can you not hold two thoughts in your head at the same time to see how you have no logical framework behind any of your positions you have essentially given the best argument for allowing people to use the restroom that matches how they live their life as real men as you say are incapable of not assaulting anything that they think might have vagina if that the way you would behave you are not real man and for the record the headline didn say men menstruate it says both sexes menstruate read it again sex and gender are different do you always have to willfully blind yourself to keep from admitting you have no valid argument against their decision and tell me how do you justify telling me in one list that trans and gay people shouldn be accommodated because they are such small minority but an even smaller practically imaginary minority of real men who are afraid of tampons should be accommodated again yoh can even keep your arguments consistent news flash honey real men aren afraid of tampons but it adorable how you have to make up someone in order to make your point why it is always big stink when it someone else freedoms why don the gay people just go somewhere else why don the black people just eat somewhere else why do they have to make big stink of riding in the front of the bus why do women have to make such big stink about wanting to vote we ve heard that one before	0
the headlines didn say transmen it said men bet could point out of your transmen in minute like said before don care what people do behind closed doors no one is denying their freedom by being against tampons in men bathrooms what about the freedoms of real men who are uncomfortable with tampons and transmen in the men bathroom bet the number is to why is it your side forgets about who it actually affects the majority see this is where freedom comes in would act like responsible human being and choose another place to go in the first place why couldn or wouldn transmen be responsible human being and just go somewhere else it so simple why make big stink like said before on your side it doesn matter that you have the freedom to go somewhere else it matters that you push an agenda oh and if an overly sensative real man freeks out and gets in fight with your transman it on you	0
woman taking very high doses of testosterone would be suppressing the process of ovulation and would experience infrequent periods or stop menstruating altogether this would be rare situation when transman needs tampon creating an ideological bathroom display by catering to mere fraction of an already tiny minority is just another part of training the young not to think for themselves but to think the thoughts of their masters	0
mangyna hypocrite trans are the most disruptive noisy element of lgbt women are under threat from them now feminists are and have always been the primary disruptors for trans and gays alike feminists have been the ones who shame gay men and attack us for being misogynists because of our role in fashion our excellence in fields traditionally attributed to femininity cuisine for instance and now they re doing it to trans and trying to drag us into it because they feel threatened indeed they are threatened because now trans are undoing most feminists bs just with their very presence from proving that gender has nothing to do with cultural norms but rather is the other way around to the fact that as trans become mainstream and accepted as women they will start competing with cisfemales who will find that they are now out of their own league once again as they are in fashion cullinary arts the liberal arts in general as bisexual support trans very much now currently involved with someone who may well be on the way to identifying as an ftm transman and find trans both the men and the women to be peculiarly attractive to me they all seem to have the best of both worlds going for them transmen have tendency to retain twinkish appearence whilst transwomen are relateable and fun to be around and both had to work hard to be what they are and defy the odds trans do have problem with having thin skin and would agree that great deal of them probably have some sort of borderline or related issue though then again the same could be said for all us queers in general but guess who taught them to be that way who gave them such expectations to begin with who where the first ones skreeching at the top of their lungs that everything is rape and that every little detail of our culture is steeped in patriarchy to the point where everything must end in person and words like mankind and brotherhood are seen as oppressive or that society owes to change itself due to the needs or wants even of specific group and just to refresh your memories though trans might be somewhat uneasy about drag recall that the worst critics of the art where traditionally feminists who attacked if ironically for similar reasons they attack trans now and they where all too happy to side with trans against us that moment marriage equality was achieved in the usa then you started seeing the slew of gay men are misogynist articles emerging in full force you see the pattern here feminists are playing us against one-another when we should be united against them	0
allowing for transwomen to be woman dies absolutely nothing to you you re still woman pearl clutching aside you define yourself as woman don have to define you as anything take your gender expression to be who you are if you were transman use the urinal next to you	0
my point was that there could have been no benefit motivation to transition in the military the benefits aren there also that job training and building career within the year commitment is encouraged by the military transmen in the military is nothing new albert cashier was transman who regiment fought ton of battles in the civil war he served at risk to his own life in war where tshtf with horrific outcomes he was captured at one point and overwhelmed his guard to return to union lines so he clearly didn tuck tail sorry if the facts don line up with your worldview maybe someday you ll rethink how you might be wrong on few of your deeply held beliefs	0
omg thought she was transman in the ladies room when saw that shake it off	0
is heidi transman	0
its transman dont pay attention	0
he has vagina if he goes into the men room in your scenario he is breaking the law so he should have to use the women bathroom right after all transwomen need to use the men according to you so transman would have to use the ladies	0
so this guy would be in no danger if he goes into the women bathroom ps ftm transman has vagina	0
so you think this guy should use the ladies room think women might feel bit uncomfortable if he walked in ps he is transman aka born with vagina	0
so you don believe transman aka transgender person born with vagina transitioning to male should be in the women room but should be in the men	0
now ask them if they want their wives in the shower with transman like this better yet ask their wives	0
but you have no issues with your spouse showering with transman like this	0
but you be okay if he came into the women room hint he transman	0
transman or transwoman get confused	0
wonder how well transman female who thinks she male will fare going into the men room at muslim business or mosque in dearborn	0
so imagine transman who has gone through some level of physical transition and looks more like man than woman now forced to go back into the women restroom where woman freaks out and contacts some macho guy who comes in and beats up the transman br br don transmen have legal case against the state for forcing them to go back into the women restrooms where they are at risk of physical harm by oblivious and or ignorant people	0
all humor aside have to say my admiration for donald trump is greater than ever from the moment he announced every single commentator highly paid consultant and blogger and politician denounced him and thought he would be out in few weeks the self annointed arrogant kings like jeb bush rick perry bobby jindals marco rubio rand paul carly fiorina and the other darlings of the establishment were beaten fairly and squarely by him while he had to battle the slander and vitriol poured out by celebrities and media and even unbelievably self called buffon conservatives like george will and consevative review elites of his own party he achieved something that no one predicted he could do not single person in media believed it however the american public had seen it lifelong denocrat and knew who was voting for from the first speech trump was my candidate and my hope for america no other candidate talked about making america great only he did so consistently bush infact wanted to represent mexicans hillary wants to represent the corrupt democratic machinery now pray we can all unite and elect trump he truly will turn about the mess created over the last two administrations the race activists the professional victims and the elites both in washington and in media this is pivotal time in america and we have seen victory we need to ensure trump is the next president thank you mr trump	0

americans are not like any other people on earth we will not lie down and allow our country to be taken from us we are the toughest brightest most loyal and patriotic people on earth liberals want us to believe differently the liberals with help from the pope european leaders saudia arabia and the un will actually empty africa if that is what it takes to destroy america the people who were elected to represent us are all traitors republican and denocrat alike they have plan and that plan is to break american spirit to thin our population with enough foreign born that we will not have the ability to stop them the people who believe they are superior from us have no morals they are commiting treason and no longer care if we know it the omnibus bill is an act of war they have now funded another million or more enemy combatants the right to invade our country these are all people who are in their prime who have been brought here to occupy and then seize power of our country every day they demand changes christian symbols need to be removed halal food must be served islamic holidays must be recognized the omnibus bill is bribe it gives our enemy lifetime benefits and citizen status from the moment their feet land in our country congress cannot get their lies straight first the funding is for refugees then we hear them say the funding is for visa workers here is my question if they are either refugees or workers why are they being given lifetime benefits will tell you why obama michelle john kerry and members of congress have been making trips to african nations and arabian countries bribing our enemy the so called refugees are only syrian the rest come from ethiopia somalia libya iraq afghanistan etc they are coming here to occupy our nation to steal our daughters and to enslave our sons	0
am confused at who these folks are that have no id br br by now they should have some inkling that an election is upcoming assuming that they so want to vote br br the requirement of showing an id is logical and the practice in virtually every country where citizens vote can you name country where citizens are not required to br br one would think that with months of lead time an aspiring voter would arrange to get an id br br this fuss seems to be more hindrance to the denocrat practice of driving around scraping up poor people off the streets bussing them to the polling place and ordering them to vote for free meal	0

hilliara is gonna lose weight	0
too late it widespread among delegates to the dem convention the msm is rife with it only the girls at fox news escaped infection all the dems had their brains infected hilliara included	0
didn know that tony blair was playing the clinton cash game to such an extent has he raked in anything like the swag bill and hilliara do	0

why don you crawl back under hilliara fat arse you ll just love the perfume she uses	0
so much money to sow off bad taste so little money to show off real style hilliara made the jacket look like burlap sack ivanka spends so little to look like million bucks guess which one doesn need to grift for living	0
in my view the bernie supporters might turn to trump because of the authenticity factor bernie went far because he was seen as authentic the real thing---which hilliara is not trump in his own way is also authentic the real thing the millennials are getting tired of the posturing the fakery the make-believe the trimming and the flip-flop by endorsing hilliara bernie forfeited his authenticity trump still has his we ll just have to wait and see---	0
the endorsement announcement was the funniest thing ve seen in years bernie at the podium clapping hilliara on the shoulder as she stands next to him smiling and nodding at every word that fell from his lips indescribably delicious	0
once more hilliara raises an issue that originated with her an issue that causes all manner of remembrance of her own words and deeds is she really that arrogant that stupid that rash---or is she just defying the american people to down-vote her for legitimate cause thinking that all her past and bubba will be disregarded just to elect woman president in either case it takes really horrendous gall to play these cards	0
if the dems steal california for hilliara look for big time trouble at philadelphia followed by more all over the country	0
people are leery about taxes because they realise that it gets blown on waste fraud skim and useless projects of all kinds people do not trust dc any more in fact people want dc cut down to size---which is why they go for trump other people go for bernie because they think he for real no matter how delusional hilliara is for loot and for herself alone for democrats bernie represents the future---the segue toward outright socialism for republicans trump represents chance to seriously purge dc	0
corey booker has more name recognition specially back east out west people don know who he is chalk this screw-up to hilliara campaign staff they should have booked him to speak in newark and hilliara anywhere else they made corey waste his time	0
hilliara is said to have named kaine solely because he would not upstage her same old story obama fifth or sixth rate man appoints hilliara and kerry who are seventh or eighth rate persons to high office under him now that one of those seventh or eighth rate people are running for high office needs to name an underling she chooses ninth or tenth rate man how far down the stairwell can this succession go apparently such people cannot or will not appoint first rate men or women to work for them lest they be upstaged so when will the voters recognise and elect first rate people who will appoint first rate people first rate people do not fear being upstaged we need first rate men in high office not the grossly inferior and incompetent	0
there is that notorious picture of hilliara doing her miss piggy pose while wearing stars stripes bikini people tell me that they need brain bleach after they see it they become very angry with me for mentioning it	0
suppose donald trump is elected could he even trust the media to report anything done or talked up by his administration honestly how can he govern aright and be understood to be governing aright when the media are spinners and fabulists against him and allhis works he also needs to contemplate the effects of having both hilliara and obama residing in dc constantly carping to their media allies donald is going to have to take some punishing steps to concentrate minds he cannot hop to persuade them	0
hilliara and the dems can be so stupid they start squalling about donald the war on women and what happens lots of reminders about bubba lechery and rapine they squall about the dnc hack and the russians and what happens their own connections with the russians come to light they just can get over their penchant of using deflection and projection to hoist themselves by their own actions hilliara we remember was the originator of the birther affair--and the obamas keep reminding us of it what happens if the whole story in obama sealed records comes to light we are told that julian assange of wikileaks has lots more on the clintons and the dems---and julian would just loove to nail hilliara and obama to the barn wall as would any number of others they screwed over keep it up deems you re just asking for it bend over	0
do not know that bubba or hilliara or obama or babygotback ever sacrificed for the country bubba was the consummate draft-dodger hilliara faked aan enlistment in the marines barry never thought of military service probably unfit for service and babygotbck is too into getting back at the country for them it all power and pelf	0
obama did parrot the dnc hilliara line about russia maybe later he decided to pussyfoot	0
there is more to it than this hilliara is long said to be more hawkish than her husband it is entirely possible that she may have had something to do with the expansion eastward of nato setting at naught the formal commitment by chw bush not to do so bush wanted to bring russia more into europe and put an end to tensions of old and to increase the prosperity of all europe thereby the expansion of nato eastward along with bubba noises about making the black sea nato lake put an end to this rapproche the ver likely us-sponsored coup in the ukraine caused russia to annex the crimea to protect her vital national security interests should hilliara be elected it is very possible that an attempt will be made to bring the ukraine into nato this would immediately precipitate russian annexation of the eastern and southern part of the ukraine again to protect vital national security interests there is also the rapidly escalating islamisation of western europe and britain which could render nato unreliable further it is in russia vital national security interes that the visefrad group stand firm in not allowing mass muslim migration into their countries for now russia might regard the visegrad group form of buffer between russia and an islamised western europe should the visegrad group be coerced into allowing mass muslim migration into their countries russia might well regard her western frontier with the visegrad countries very threatened---and might contemplate forcible restoration of the warsaw pactr this in tern could would precipitate war with nato----all because of the arrogance and stupidity and rashness of hilliara does anyone want that	0
hilliara is in it for the money can we imagine the swag and pelf she will garner for the clinton family foundation think in terms of billions not mere millions	0
reaganism is nearly perfect balance destroyed the ussr as well paul and obama are both worse than useless	0
don think so did you read his books and watch yt videos from previous decades if you do so one thing becomes crystal clear this is guy who strongly admired reagan and his down-to-earth version of conservatism based on fundamental love for and trust in ordinary hard-working americans and then ex-marxist invented neoconservatism and in took over the gop and dc is the only period trump switched parties and the policies he proposing today go right against neocon ideology and return to reaganism so imho he entered the race precisely because he saw that this is the time for strong and financially independent candidate to break through show people how much the neocon gope has lied to them and what disastrous results they have produced in this way he could achieve twofold goal to give the party back to the base to definitively break the neocon hostile takeover of the gope and open it up to reagan conservatives again he already been achieving both goals so in that sense can understand that consultant believes that he not necessarily in it in order to become president himself and that every step that leads to the wh and that is step towards the destruction of the neocons made the investment in time money and energy worthwile in itself on the other hand he is known as winner who once he starts something always goes for the full prize so absolutely convinced that he ll do everything to go all the way and has very good chance to become the next president of the usa	0
there major difference reagan tax cuts respected the laffer principle and in the long run it paid off by the end of his eight years tax revenues had doubled again these are ideas that are part and parcel of reaganism trump plan sounds the same but it goes overboard it ignores the laffer principle the perfect tax rate does two things stimulates growth and increases tax revenues trump plan would stimulate growth yes but not enough to overcome the immediate drastic cut in tax revenues and the long term reduction from rates that are too low to reach revenue targets on the corporate rate is about as low as they should go that was romney proposal	0
so much for reaganism right	0
yes it traditioinal to refer to president world view is an ism sorry that you re ashamed of obamaism while conservatives proud of reaganism	0
shut the fvk up you don have monopoly on reaganism reply	0
neocon globalist an oxymoron and pinguin romney never managed to fire up the gop base he hates so much so the gop lost the wh today trump is completely waking up and energizing and expanding the gop base which in itself is yuuuge advantage in the general elections but who does the establishment now want to impose globalist neocon cruz who never really connected with the base neither reason why as he himself admitted he needed the help of sarah palin to win his election as senator can even unite all of the deep south and never had any rally remotely comparable to what trump is doing so go ahead gope oppose trump and support cruz in that way trump will start new real grand old party based on reaganism rather than neoconservatism and annihilate the neocon hostile takeover of the gop which will de facto have destroyed it themselves	0
the reaganism hooverism free market free trade policies practiced by both parties over the last years has decimated the american middle class ross perot warned us during the presidential campaign that the end result of these policies would be giant sucking sound of jobs leaving the us the free market free trade policies are responsible for massive transfer of american jobs to foreign countries massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the super wealthy and massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to china and other foreign outsourcing destinations president obama defends the tpp agreement in part by saying that the companies that wanted to move american jobs overseas have already done so true unfortunately if companies decide tomorrow or decide next week or decide next year or later to move jobs overseas they will do so true fix the inequities in old trade agreements first analyze the results of the fixes over substantial period of time next and only then consider the possibility of new trade agreements	0
what these conservative radio hosts like levin rush beck and crew don realize is that the brand of reagan conservatism they espouse is considered obsolete and borderline failure by many modern grassroots conservatives these new conservatives feel that polices like trickle down economics open borders free trade and global interventionism have done more harm than good so more protectionist isolationist america first conservatism is quickly replacing reaganism and by the results of the republican primary it appears the new conservatives have surpassed the reagan conservatives and are now the majority	0
peter morici you are so off base guess we need to modernize the constitution too reaganism is based in solid principles and tried and true results even when it watered down with progressivism for political appeasement principles are not living breathing documents what you are really missing is that the education system was hijacked in the by liberals and todays adults cannot fathom or comprehend the constitution much less how this great nation genesis took place and why try again	0

all too familiar with romney flip-flops from climate change to abortion to gun control to reaganism to bailouts to stimuli to mandates etc it just rare to see any politician do the flip-flop then flip-flop back to where they were before the first flip-flop it takes man who is absolutely shameless to pull off such feat	0
despite cruz being chastised for his lies by carson trump kasich huckabee and rubio self ordained scholars limbaugh levin reilly are now freely promoting such behavior by mr cruz is it any wonder that reaganism went into the crapper on their watch and extraordinary people like carson trump and others sacrifice their precious time to try and help our country while these radio and tv turds continue to sit back gab and make fortune	0
except for the fact that of all conservatives the us has known only neocons systematically oppose all kinds of tax increases even in times of two big wars overseas the result bush left with record and structural trillion deficit that will only dissappear decades later even if the next president doesn write any single new spending bill into law and why do neocons like cruz and bush oppose all tax increases because in real life they only oppose tax increases for the wealthiest americans most of their biggest donors all while secretly increasing lot of taxes for ordinary citizens no more lies no more neocons trump has always been reagan republican and neocons hate nothing more than reaganism that why they re paying cruz and his campaign manager bush today to stay in the race and try to split the vote even when cruz cannot possibly win anymore	0
this is not about reason it entirely about emotions trump is nothing more than lightning rod for rage that why he can do no wrong with these crazies as peter king calls them big part of the problem is caused by independents invading the party they are populist know nothing movement at war with reaganism and so ignorant they don even realize it they have no interest in policy ideas on the contrary they want to destroy policy discussion they just want someone to rage against the party the real question is will real republicans allow them to destroy their election chances they can wreck the party itself because all the elected members and rnc executive leadership are reaganite they will still be in control of the party no matter what happens next november but if trump is the nominee they will be in the minority again and we ll have dem in the wh believe it ends one of two ways- reaganite repubs coalesce around one candidate and defeat this insurgency trump is the nominee and the convention is fractured even worse then the rnc and rest of the party turn their back on him refuse to roll out the campaign machine and he gets slaughtered in the national election they would put all the effort into supporting repubs at the state and local levels instead they prefer dem in the wh than trump as party leader because in the end defending the party will take precedence over capturing the wh in four years they can try again oddsmakers say it will be option jeb remains odds on favorite to capture the nomination it worth noting their opinion because the bookies have proven themselves more accurate forecasters than any polling group	0
trump for return to reaganism we need fair trade	0
the rnc is not supposed to fall in behind anybody other than the nominee in reality they will never support trump never he doesn belong in the party all those elected members he been personally insulting they are the republican party he was willing to cross that line and now if nominated will pay the price for it none of them or the rnc will support his national campaign and he would be shot down in flames he will have no ground game in whole towns counties even states he populist one-off once he gone they get the party back so trashing his national campaign would be no brainer from their perspective they sooner ride out four years of failed dem prez and wait to run real republican in it would save the party save reaganism and save their hides	0
being involved does not mean more vietnams or iraqs it means not being played for patsy and having the stomach to protect true national interests like paul he is my second choice but prefer reaganism and cruz is closer for me	0
bernie only wants to reverse reaganism and guarantee rights to citizens there is such thing as way too wealthy despite what the pea brains believe	0
was stunned by last night gop response it basically said vote republican and we will solve problems with the federal government differently from the way the democrats will solve problems with the federal government the establishment have moved far away from reaganism and states rights and have morphed into moderate democrats	0
trumpism and reaganism absolutely no comparison	0
wtf thought the germans wanted multi-culturalism punish migrants who do not integrate says senior member the german government should consider punishing migrants who refuse to integrate into wider society senior member of chancellor angela merkel christian democratic union cdu has said julia kl ckner who is running for president of the rhineland-palatinate region next month wrote in rheinische post that mrs merkel administration should reassert german values and get tough on those who refuse to adopt them she said the integration of migrants should not be left to chance and called for the government to accompany them as they settle in german but then said it should consider penalising those who do not integrate many migrants strive to come to germany because they admire our country but what they often underestimate is that our success is based on the principle of the rule of law we live in an ultra-modern liberal and enlightened society she continued we fought for our liberties and are determined to defend them therefore if anyone cannot cope with this they have chosen the wrong country the cdu is proposing series of reforms to the country migrant policy new arrivals may be excluded from the minimum wage spend longer in compulsory education or face stricter criteria for permanent residence according to the latest proposals it is not clear whether these will be implemented however after the social democratic party mrs merkel coalition partners banded them populist and threatened to oppose them last week the country federal employment ba agency warned germany could only absorb new working age migrants year despite well over million people coming to the country last year the figure which amounts to around half of the new jobs created annually was revealed by ba board member detlef scheele who also said the previous week that migrants would go directly onto state benefits and that we should not have too high expectations of them finding gainful

if trump was such lib why do you think liberals hate him so much the whole idea of trump being liberal is totally absurd in real life he has been registered republican longer than the two cubans taken together not being neocon does not mean not being conservative no matter what neocons may say neoconservatism was only invented in the reaganism and many other versions of conservatism have always existed and will continue to exist whether neocons like it or not and the more neocons start to spread lies about anti-neocons like trump the more people will see what big fat liars those neocons are and turn away from them and empower the other gop wings still available and now even more vibrant than ever before	0

it not that disagree with what the author above writes but do believe that he missing the point kristol and his neocons for those who didn know this irving kristol an ex-marxist and bill father invented new version of conservatism which he called neoconservatism in the and that the doctrine that has taken over the gop for two decades now are first of all ideologues that means that they are convinced that their doctrine contains the absolute truth and that america will only be saved if and only if the neocon doctrine thrives so protecting and enhancing that ideology and those who believe in it is their first priority is neoconservatism really version of conservatism that can be doubted of course but to me that not the main problem here the main problem is that according to neocon doctrine conservatives who support other versions of conservatism than neoconservatism reaganism for instance are their enemies too as they only recognize one absolute truth their own so when very popular dem gets into the wh neocons focus on getting it back using typical neocon strategy based on the idea that ordinary citizens are too stupid to see why they detain the absolute truth lying about their own ideas and about lot of what obama has done and taking extremist positions on social issues in order to fire up the base that how they got congress back but now that trump is revealing their true ideas and taking the entire party back to reagan conservatism neocons feel that they may now even lose their grip on the gop and as consequence cease to exist that when from neocon perspective their focus has to shift their priority now is to maintain some political relevance and if that isn possible inside the gop anymore they will have to found new third party if that party splits the conservative vote and alows hillary to become president at least neocons will have proven that when the gop nominates an anti-neocon it gets nowhere and that they hope will force republicans to turn their eyes to neocons again during the next election or at least will it have prevented trump from getting rid of the neocon movement entirely something he would certainly succeed to do once he becomes the nominee whether he wins the general election or not	0
saw how years of reaganism can totally erase the wrongs of years of socialism don doubt for min years of trumpism will do the same	0

ben shapiro will never vote for donald trump here why will never vote for donald trump because stand with certain principles stand with small government and free markets and religious freedom and personal responsibility donald trump stands against all of these things he stands for planned parenthood and trade restrictions and targeting of political enemies and an anti-morality foreign policy and government domination of religion and nastiness toward women and tacit appeals to racism and unbounded personal power stand with the constitution of the united states and its embedded protection of my god-given rights through governmental checks and balances donald trump does not stand with conservatism donald trump stands against it stand with nevertrump the counterargument to the nevertrump movement comes down to two words hillary clinton trump will supposedly close the borders lie hillary will not trump will appoint conservative supreme court justices unlikely hillary will not no matter how bad trump is the argument goes conservatives have duty to back the anti-hillary think trump will get blown out in general election but let assume that these critics of nevertrump are right let assume that but for we nevertrump voters sitting out the election trump would become president and hillary would go down in flaming defeat and let assume that hillary clinton will appoint terrible justices destroy the military and usher in the apocalypse why in the world would conservatives live with president hillary clinton on their consciences because first it not on our consciences it on the consciences of the people who went along with this nomination we did not select trump we will not vote for him and if we are going to save the country it will not rest on one or two justices on the supreme court it will rest on the will of the people to resist tyranny that will start at the state and local level it will start with the people it will start with conservatives willing to say no because if we never say no we will never have the opportunity to say yes we must have conservative party the republican party is not that party and has not been for very long time the obama administration has brought about unique moment transformational choice for the party will they abandon all conservative principle in pursuit of victory or will they turn back to the conservatism they supposedly espouse this entire election cycle the answer has been the former in fact for virtually my entire life the answer has been the former establishment republicans abandoned reaganism for bushism and then abandoned bushism for mccainism and then abandoned mccainism for romneyism until the last five minutes they were ready to embrace trump himself rather getting behind senator ted cruz r-tx now they call for conservatives to swallow hard and unify behind man who opposes all conservative principles to save conservatism in every election cycle the establishment insists that we unify behind candidate who does not reflect conservatism because elections are always choice between the two worst options they blackmail conservatives into supporting candidates who undermine the message and morality of our mission now trump does the same the establishment created the donald trump phenomenon with their best of two bad options logic and now trump is using that logic to destroy conservatism openly the establishment doesn object to trumpism they only object to trump strip the drunken boor antics from trump and you ve got john mccain who will lie transparently to pander to the populist wing we don have to be complicit as ben domenech is fond of citing alexander hamilton once wrote if we must have an enemy at the head of government let it be one whom we can oppose and for whom we are not responsible let us not be our own enemies make no mistake about it- trump is no alexander hamilton let alone no ronald reagan ie trump is narcissistic self-grandizing pompous lying hypocrite whose soul purpose is to promote trump to enrich trump now is the time to say no no is useful tool if conservatives don say no to nelson rockefeller in there is no ronald reagan if conservatives don say no to gerald ford in and george bush in there is no ronald reagan and if we don say no to donald trump now we will continue drifting ever further left diluting conservatism into the vacillating demagogic absurdity of trumpism conservatism will become the crypto-racist pseudo-strong quasi-tyrannical toxic brew leftists have always accused it of being and we will have been complicit in that will not be complicit in that stand against the establishment that sowed the seeds of trumpism stand against the republican party that insists that victory matters more than principle because victory without principle isn just meaningless it counterproductive to my belief system nevertrump truth it what for breakfast lunch and dinner	0

thanks for your interesting reply here my opinion about what you re saying but can be wrong of course so ll be happy to hear your arguments in case that what you believe concretely in real life cruz never achieved anything on all the issues you re mentioning time and again he just said no if you re lawmaker that might increase your name recognition but it certainly not what will allow you to make some progress for those who elected you the only thing that the constitution itself stipulated that you can do as an elected official to make real tangible progress is to enter real tough negotiations with those who disagree cruz never even tried to do so that why concretely he never obtained anything and why is it that this is how cruz has decided to work during his years in the senate to me it not just because he never trained his negotiating skills it was also deliberate decision to first of all prioritize increasing his name recognition by saying no in the most spectacular ways and secondly to try to cultivate the idea that being real conservative means being pure ideologically speaking which should somehow imply that you say no to everything that is not the way you re supposed to want it so all this was pure calculation just like his use of faith in order to advance his career is first of all calculation and the extent to which he been lying and cheating proves that he really doesn care that much about faith at all finally when it comes to immigration there no issue he has flip-flopped more one as career politician than this one so what does he stand for personally nobody actually knows what is certain is that he never supported most of what trump is proposing before trump was proposing it and was the frontrunner so here too imho he merely calculating in function of his own career and that it and then there of course the fact that his career is financed by exactly the same big banks that financie rubio and bush careers and that before there was the trump factor he was and often still is defending exactly the same neocon policies that we already know are not only based on an incoherent doctrine but also extremely dangerous for the gop as well as america that why to me no one should be criticized more than cruz you see at least rubio for instance isn hiding the fact that he neocon establishment guy and he isn lying about his rivals neither so to me this race should be about establishment neocons versus reaganism which means rubio versus trump and if you believe cruz is anti-establishment and that what you want imho you should vote for trump certainly not for cruz but that only my opinion of course so if you disagree ll be happy to read you	0
the attacks by the establishment on trump are unprecedented except perhaps by what was previously done to palin when sarah was piled on very few came to support her trump did and sarah is returning the favor but there is more to this friendship clearly they share chemistry that enjoys family country authenticity tradition accountability american spirit reaganism winners they despise the establishment knowing that is what eventually brings every great country to ruin they are willing to fearlessly face it down and remove it from its present pulpit of danger in the process of the nation returning to conservative ideals we must then ourselves take part in defining what constitutional conservatism is and not let establishment radio hosts tv scholars or other self ordained experts purport to it for us	0

they always refer back to reagan but the fact of the matter is the bush couldn dismantle reaganism fast enough and they worship the bush clan as soon as reagan walked out the white house door for the last time they were busy dismantling his policies and replacing them with globalism can remember when last year all these free trade cultists were cucks and rino even according to levin but apparently today they re the true conservatives	0
first of all reagan increased lot of tariffs and often by just as trump proposes but as all neocons like levin and cruz and bush opposes so on tariffs it trump who being reagan republican certainly not neocons as to nafta yes years ago many including reagan believed it was good idea just like reagan believed amnesty was good idea in the meanwile things have changed lot so on those two issues it neocons who continue to pretend as if nothing went wrong whereas trump has the guts to go back to the very spirit of reaganism which was to oppose all kinds of dogmatic ideas about conservatism and to accept to change your opinion when facts had proven it wrong it that down-to-earth pragmatic version of conservatism that trump clearly admired from the very beginning and is now taking over whereas neocons have always believed in exactly the oppostie giving priority to ideology rather than to facts and doubling down on the same failed strategy when neocon doctrine says that sooner or later it should lead to success and as neocons have taken over the gop and dc for two decades now the best way to prove that you re part of the gope is to start defending neocon ways of thinking as levin and cruz have been constantly doing during their entire career	0

rubio and kasich are neocons and trump entered the race to end the neocon takeover of the gop and take the party back to reaganism so yes they re antipodes but no manafort idea is not as much about getting delegates from other candidates than it is about getting influence in the committee that determines the convention rules and those delegates are mere rank and file republicans who are afraid of any radical change but didn support anyone yet starting to publicly merely verbally praise some gope candidates may calm them down so is crucial step in the process if you still don get it just read the bb article about reagan and manafort that explains this in detail	0
million votes that how bad romney lost those aren found among idle disenchanted or lazy conservatives the biggest myth of the last years spread by limbaugh levin et al is that conservatism is ascending fiscal conservatism has been fully discredited for it dogmatic globalism that is killing america what the financial crisis didn prove rampant illegal labor practices have neo-conservatism and conservative national security are feared and loathed by most people who now realize it futility in the mideast and social conservatism is more and more in disfavor as our youth embraces gays atheism and libertarianism bottom line who gives shlt about conservatives nationalism is the new reaganism	0
he won be the nominee reagan remade the party in his image with new ideology and whole set of policy ideas trump brings nothing of the sort with which to replace reaganism trump might conceivably bring in enough populists to undermine the party but not the ideology it would simply result in politcal chaos with the republican party morphing into the populist party and the republicans going off to create new reaganite party the obvious resolution is for trump and his mix of lefty-righty rabble to go and form their own party with their own chosen candidates then trump can be populist and the rino can go back to simply being called republicans	0
not wise move on his part for those of us who remember who destroyed the reaganites this week marks the twenty-sixth anniversary of the massacre of the reaganites by newly elected president george bush that effectively ended the prospect of institutionalizing reaganism as the governing principle of the republican party and america	0
the bush family are the ultimate rinos the two greatest spending presidents in the gop were daddy bush and junior and did the most to reverse reaganism junior is the greatest spending president in the history of the republic except for obama reagan couldn stand bush was forced to take him as vp and always kept him away from the action junior is of the same ilk just little more lost looking as in lumpy from leave to beaver	0
revised reaganism applies here don trust until you can verify	0
okay so you seem somewhat willing to read the other side check out noam chomsky book called manufacturing consent and perhaps you ll see what we are getting from the corporate press or check out the for media criticism it very concise stuff as for your reference to college and the leftist agenda if you look at public opinion on number of key issues you ll find big majorities of americans across the political spectrum who support strenghtening social security environmentalism clean water and an increase in the minimum wage these people aren leftists what the right fails to understand is just how small sector of the population they really are regarding those publications mentioned yes they take advertising but they aren owned by big money the way big media is you want common sense and claim the left has none well if you don pay people enough for them to both feed their families and pay the rent we aren going to have much growth in the economy reaganism has been all about enriching the already wealthy bush doubled down on that obama while still catering to the monied class like any good republican has at least gotten about an extra billion out of them while lowering taxes for percent of the rest of us you could look it up oh he such lefty	0
lot if the gope decides to give the nomination once again to globalist neocon kasich cruz ryan romney bush even though clear majority of the base wants trump and going back to down-to-earth reaganism really hope that trump will start new party the party of reagan conservatives he may not win this time around but during the next decade once even cruz supporters will start to understand how incoherent and perverted neoconservative ideology is it could perfectly be this third party that becomes the only legitimate heir of the grand old party our constitutional power as citizens is our vote we should stop voting for candidates we don believe in if we do so confident that in the end the gope will be destroyed	0
that must be trump representing reaganism kasich representing neoconservatism and neocon cruz trying to look like trump so only counting for half man	0
in real life they all rubio cruz halley clearly believe in neoconservatism and in accepting tons of campaign money from big globalist wall street banks whereas trump is the only one to hate neoconservatism because of the fact that it almost destroyed the gop and the us and to bring the party back to down-to-earth reaganism what people hate about cruz is his creepy lying character and personality but not his ideas nor his financial bosses and bush family ties which are as neocon as it can get	0
limbaugh claims rubio farewell speech was the best he ever heard except for his own speeches by his own admission limbaugh demo his place in history as only gabber with such insight it is no wonder that despite having all believe otherwise he has not moved the conservative ball forward in his whole career quite the contrary reaganism has been gutted on his watch back to rubio never being the potus was no brainer from the jump no resume talks too fast easy bet here still limbaugh claims rubio is gifted politician it makes me wonder who has less cerebral capacity rush or rubio whatever these guys are do nothing artists it is disappointing trump has done more to advance conservative issues into national narrative in months than has limbaugh levin the filthiest mouth on the air in history beck hewitt fox and the rest of the right con estab since reagan trump will be potus and levin do something useful with your mouth for your country bite your wrists	0
actually respect them contrary to lyin ted kasich is an out-of-the-closet globalist neocon openly defending neoconservatism and the battle for the very soul of the gop is indeed about neoconservatism versus reaganism there no place here for neocon like cruz trying to create the image of being like trump this should be between kasich and trump	0
from all corners only from neocons like himself exactly the ones trump has been effectively destroying in order to give the party back to the base and go back to down-to-earth reaganism	0
as something back in that day actually miss the relative bliss we all had before and this mess in the mid-east and our post-ferguson racial nonsense sure we had islamic attacks overseas and simpson and the riots but we also had reaganism strength fall of the soviet union the dream team the internet revolution and an entire romance of america winning am dismissing the philandering in the white house by the horndog in chief bubba because even he was just moralistic joke on late-night teevee newt gingrich got him to sign to welfare reform for pete sake donald trump is right we don win anymore	0
this is really about breaking the power of the neocons indeed the only time trump left the gop was from to when the neocons controled the wh and congress resulting in records structural trillion deficit the biggest recession since the great depression and totally destabilized middle east that made isis possible the inventors of neocons such as kristol father were ex-stalinists who believe that is would be possible to create new version of conservatisim this time based on the same philosophical foundations as marxism hegelianism it has been totally incoherent doctrine completely fact-free that included the idea that the base would never understand its truth which meant that voters had to be lied to if not they would never elect neocons convinced that trump entered the race only in order to break the neocon hostile takeover of the gop and give the party back to its base all while returning to very different brand of conservatism reaganism cruz however has always been neocon and is financed by neocon big donors but as long as his voters believe that he anti-establishment and his delegates accept to join trump delegates his donors won be able to use him to destroy trump no more neocons no more lies	0
reagan did not intend to be stimulus spendor but he couldn get his major military increase without making compromises with tip niell that included expanding afdc aid to families with dependent children that ended in debacle of youth crime and welfare reform in the but combined the two types of increases amounted to debt spending above all it proved once again that jack in defense spending stimulates the economy and creates jobs as point of economic philosophy it is sound bernanke did his job it was up to the president and the congress to do theirs they haven and bernanke most important advice was posthumous from milton friedman it was friedman teaching about the roots of the depression that guided bernanke and friedman was ronald reagan number one economic advisor supply-side is taken in great part from friedman conservative economic philosophies you apparently like making up facts volcker was easing rates throughout reagan presidency it was done in coordination with reagan new growth policies you doubt my reaganism because you don understand reagan so that to be expected trump will get slaughtered because he has no wing in the party and the rnc would provide no support in the general election he lose worse than goldwater who had the same problems but not like this trump would go down in flames and take the repub majority with him after goldwater lost in landslide it was thirty years before the repubs captured the house in the gingrich revolution trumpoids don care about the history economics or geopolitics they re in love with their bombastic candidate entertainer just like obama supporters were but fortunately this one won be the nominee and finally you re no conservative you re populist yahoo like trump and reagan republicans have no use for his childish act	0
worked for the reagan campaign in and have voted republican in every presidential election since trump is the rino his herbert hoover ideas are out of step with the party reaganism there is no trump wing in the party because he not republican he would lead fractured convention get no rnc support in the general election go down in flames and take the republican majority with him bernanke republican appointee did the opposite of what was done in the depression that why we ve had growth instead of depression last quarter gdp growth rate was annualized that perfect for the us economy but it will slow again and there remain serious problems that need to be addressed by grow ups not some billionaire yahoo selling political snake oil	0
except for the whole amnesty or selling weapons to iran deal no more of that type of reaganism please	0
it not just another election but do or die for america it either more of hussein in hillary or back towards reaganism in trump which was great for the country	0
hang tough our guy will emerge it all about narrowing the field the biggest impact jeb is going to make is when he drops out that ll shake things up that probably comes after iowa-nh he will fall on sword for reaganism and get behind rubio still silly season until new year that when it ll get more serious	0
donald trump is left of hillary on national healthcare left of bernie sanders on trade taxes and foreign policy if trump is the nominee many republicans like myself will be forced to vote for hillary as the conservative choice trump policy proposals have nothing to do with ronald reagan neither does anything else about him if you support trump you hate reagan it that simple reaganism didn leave the party but some republicans ceased to be reaganites obviously in fact they re now on the far left with their populist yahoo trump	0
yes the corrupt duopoly is terrible that what years of reaganism got us and that the dino too nonetheless it still not desert island nor somalia though it heading that way or perhaps someplace much worse it up to the citizens to petition call protest boycott and strike as needed preferable coordinated to force the corrupt gov and the rich and their corporation to do as we demand else we all need to learn to kneel that the founders liberal vision the dem are reagan conservatives dlc new democrats they are corporate sellouts too the progressive caucus and the green party are the only folks even marginally on the citizens side the media is controlled by corporations and they have taught us to hate liberals and the green party and see big money and corporations as our savior that not working	0
in real life they mean the end of the neocon grip on the gop trump and trump alone is showing how much they have been lying and despising conservatives and takes the party back to reaganism in way that neocons cannot possibly stop anylonger so it their entire worldview that is at stake here and their jobs of course	0
reaganism vs neoconservatism	0
imho you re wrong kristol is neocon before cruz started to imitate trump policies during his campaign he clearly was neocon too and cruz is financed by exactly the same neocon globalist big banks as rubio jeb and hillary it just that the gope hired him to first say no to everthing in the senate and the make people believe that he too is anti-establishment once real outsider would start denoucing all the neocon mistakes and lies and start taking the party back to totally different version of conservatism reaganism that why they almost don talk about cruz but constantly attack trump and plot against him every cruz supporter should from now on systematically vote for trump so that he has more than delegates before the convention and they cannot get rid of him through brokered convention anymore it the only way to stop the neocons	0

by the way both neoconservatism and reaganism oppose liberals and support the constitution the problem is that neocons almost destroyed the us and the gop during the previous two decades because of their globalist ideology and their globalist big donors that why we really have to go back to reaganism and if you look at policies only trump is doing that cruz certainly not	0
sam have no websites but thought you would find this article interesting massacre of the reaganites who what when where and how it was done you must know where the reaganites went to be able to bring them back where are the reaganites what happened to them if you are ted cruz supporter this article is important for you to understand this week marks the twenty-sixth anniversary of the massacre of the reaganites by newly elected president george bush that effectively ended the prospect of institutionalizing reaganism as the governing principle of the republican party and america we call it the massacre of the reaganites because in well-thought-out and carefully crafted purge on inauguration day practically every conservative who remained in government at the end of president ronald reagan second term and certainly any conservative of any political consequence was fired or forced to resign from their post in the federal government even those who had worked tirelessly to elect george bush president in the expectation that bush presidency would be effectively the third term of ronald reagan were dismissed within hours of bush inauguration establishment republicans such as james baker iii who had opposed many of reagan initiatives from within the administration were promoted but throughout the government reagan conservative appointees many of whom were loyal republicans who had supported bush were forced to resign were stripped of their duties or were summarily fired by new administration that wanted no part of the relatively few movement conservatives left in the government on the day ronald reagan departed washington for california the few that were left were relegated to the dim reaches of various federal office building and given few months to find another job or left on the payroll but given no responsibilities in the new administration their in-boxes filled with only magazines and with nothing substantive to do they soon left while bush partisans argued that the new president was justified in putting his own people in place the inauguration day massacre firings were more akin to political executions lists of those to be executed were drawn up and they were fired before sundown of the first day of the new bush administration in well-planned agenda to replace conservatives be they bush supporters or not with establishment republicans while most conservative critiques of george bush tend to focus on read my lips and bush abandonment of his pledge not to raise taxes the result of the inauguration day massacre firings were with no conservatives left to say hey wait minute bush quickly walked away from conservative principles on long list of policies and decisions bush reversed himself and imposed temporary ban on semiautomatic rifles so-called assault weapons after first opposing the idea he signed and advocated the americans with disabilities act creating whole new realm of litigation nightmares for businesses large and small he bailed out the troubled savings and loans banks he signed the civil rights act of making it easier for employees to sue employers he bought into global warming by signing the framework convention on climate change he created no net loss of wetlands policy out of whole cloth with little legislative authority outraging farmers and landowners across the country and in what was perhaps his most lasting and damaging betrayal of conservatives he appointed an obscure state judge david souter of new hampshire to the supreme court the massacre of the reaganites should serve as caution to conservatives who look at jeb bush and listen to his right to rise rhetoric and think he sounds pretty good how bad could third bush administration be during reagan presidency conservatives frequently said personnel is policy and bush inauguration day massacre was sure sign that he intended to abandon reagan policies and his principles despite all of bush rhetoric about the transformative power of conservative ideas jeb bush is the great white hope of the republican establishment no one else in america save hillary clinton starts the political season with larger rolodex of washington insider supporters than does jeb bush in addition to supporting all of their major policy goals from common core to amnesty for illegal aliens bush candidacy will send millions of dollars in consulting business and lucrative lobbying contracts to small but powerful coterie of bush family supporters and acolytes we limited government constitutional conservatives must recognize up front that successful jeb bush campaign would ensure that the republican establishment stays in power for at least another decade and it would also ensure that no matter if jeb or the democrat wins big government will continue to get bigger excerpted from takeover by conservative hq chairman richard viguerie	0
and let it be reminder that conservative talk radio who take every opportunity to define conservatism for everybody has no solutions never did beck is nut limbaugh levin and hannity have talked at length for years in praise of the bushes levin can be quoted as stating would be remembered as one of the great presidents of history ghw too yet in reality the bushies were the highest spending republican presidents in history was the greatest spending president until obama the bushies did more than anyone to roll back reaganism bret hume once stated that ghw had breakfast with reagan every morning for years and learned nothing for decades limbaugh and levin remained silent on these blights on reaganism instead they praised the bushes warmly and often ronald reagan couldn stand ghw bush and only took him as vp for political reasons history was made the other day when jeb left the race the bush dynasty is no more the man who did this is donald trump which the conservative base has attempted to achieve for years nevertheless mr levin and mr beck continue to trash donald trump with the most visceral attacks toward fellow conservative within memory while these attacks on trump continue the donald has within the last months advanced the conservative cause further than levn beck limbaugh hewitt and hannity have collectively in their careers what they have advanced is their wallets	0
long winded trying to hit the high notes on everything without offending anyone including levin rushbo shares his version of establishment but rush is establishment insider just like his buddy levin rush levin beck still peddle their self ordained version of pure conservatism populism blah blah blah how have these sages advanced conservative causes as compared to trump zip so now they are in damage control because donald has made them look bad and it has rendered them senseless half the time these were the turkeys that said for years what good fellows and presidents the bushies were truthfully the bushies are the quintessential rinos who did more to reverse reaganism than anyone also the greatest spending republican presidents in history rushbo your credibility is suspect stop looking over your shoulder for mark approval and stop talking out of both sides of your mouth	0
this is what all points into that direction imo his senate campaign was based on neocon policies his wife is vp at neocon globalist wall street bank he never did anything to really obtain anti-neocon bills the senate one of his biggest campaign donors is the neocon globalist bank his wife adores to work for he is bush prot just like rubio and has worked for him neil bush jeb and bush brother recently became his campaign finance director all main neocons are starting to endorse him mathematically he cannot possibly win the nomination so who is paying him to stay in it and split the vote those that trump is destroying neocons he only flip-flopped to anti-neocon policies after trump became the unchallenged frontrunner and he decided that it would be better to start imitating trump reaganism platform	0
first they blame trump for being vulgar and now all of sudden they all want to imitate him nice neocon cruz already imitated trump platform too once the rest of the neocons follow his example trump will have effectively eliminated the neocon establishment and replaced it with down-to-earth reaganism good job trump you re hired	0
living in leftist bubbles whether feminist racial academic communist or what have you amounts to way of life for millions of americans but left-wing intellectual bubbles have been cold desolate places since the reagan era with the catastrophe of the great society the undeniable success of reaganism and at last the collapse of the ussr leftist illusions were shattered leaving little but blasted dreams and bitterness expressed as pc and related programs that amounted to little more than gestures of revenge then came obama who brought it all back to life again all of it the dream of green economy the dream of universal pacifism of degraded and defeated united states of middle class subservient to its intellectual betters of universal nanny state of the conviction that the leftist delusion is intertwined with the basic nature of reality itself it became once more possible to believe in the coming socialist dawn that had motivated leftists since	0
neither one of the major political parties is capable of governing one party has no brains or heart the other has no spine one party is too incompetent to govern the other is too scared to govern the politicians of both parties are owned by big money therefore we are owned by big money we ve had years of reaganism hooverism the policies are very clear years of reaganism hooverism by both parties the results are very clear the decimation of the american middle class voting for either one of the major parties is vote for the economic suicide of the middle class scott walker and all like-minded people are threat to complete the decimation of the american middle class let me suggest that corporate welfare and billionaire welfare is profoundly more parasitic condition affecting you compared to the effect that the unemployed have on you	0
scott walker is fanatic and an extremist owned by big money and die-hard practitioner of the reaganism hooverism that has decimated the american middle class facing recall election in wisconsin was the best thing that ever happened to walker politically to survive politically in the state walker substantially toned down his rhetoric and somewhat toned down his policies which in effect masked the nature of his personality and his beliefs and somewhat insulated him from being compared to the other kooks crazies and clowns in the gop	0
disgusting man and to think used to speak highly of him that whole bushie thing has done more to reverse the fortunes of reaganism	0
reno au contraire regards el rushbo he never endorses in primaries he believes in directing gunfire at democrats he stated many many times he doesn believe in kicking conservative out of the movement for one mistake and finally moi is trumpster to the end rubio lost me more than year ago when he jumped in bed with the odious shumer originally was rubio admirer when he defeated charlie crist while displaying an avid reaganism rubio open borders exposed his fraud	0
it was an inevitability that this republican party would begin to destroy itself so much is wrong so much is wrong so much is wrong may god have mercy on the republican party it will not find its way until it leaves reaganism	0
cruz as vp pick would go exactly well as bush did for reagan reagan gets shot not even two months into his first term by the son of major bush family friend and donor imagine that bush frequently bad-mouthed and undercut reagan even to the soviets gorbachev himself commented on this bush and his crew was reportedly large factor in reagan biggest mistakes like amnesty and globalization bush and his crew were responsible for the iran-contra scandal that plagued reagan final years after reagan took the heat and bush got elected he pardoned all involved and took media silence on it bush used the presidency his own boss won for him to effectively dismantle reaganism read my lips rework the republican party into what it is today the gope bush family country club and failed hard enough to get bill clinton elected you do not let vipers like cruz or bush into your house	0
this garbage is not reaganism trump is the anti-reagan so when it comes to defining conservatism that should give you some pause huey long and george wallace were dems populism can invade either party	0
you are right but it is also time to sever the purportedly sacred connection to reaganism	0
another big government social engineering open door eic expanding common core corporatist faux republican we learned that compassionate conservative bush exploded domestic spending added of regulations and started two misguided budget-breaking wars he might not be his brother but his family is the antithesis of reaganism george sr purged the government of real reagan conservatives the only two who have any credibility with me are carson and walker we will quickly see who the real racists are	0
since lived those years would only counter with the fact that reagan successfully brought new politics to our country and our world the middle class grew stronger as did our intelligence agencies and military effective tactical operations were used instead of long-term interventions we are still paying heavily for carter huge holier than thou failure in the middle east allowing the shah to fall it my opinion that the reagan inspiration americanism strength economic and military effective government freedom and individualism was either severely bastardized or totally disposed of by all of the subsequent presidents so it may be god willing that trump will revive reaganism with appropriate adjustments for history since then and current circumstances there lot to be fixed in order for more americans to achieve dream of individual success and to be proud or prouder that they are americans	0
he points toward new republican party beyond the dogmas of reaganism hmmm reagan did offer amnesty to million illegal aliens move he later admitted was his biggest mistake hope that what he means	0
no matter what happens in this election what trump represents isn crazy and it not going away he continued he points toward new republican party beyond the dogmas of reaganism he points even beyond the remaking of one party to new american politics that overcomes denial rejects bubble thinking and reckons with reality thiel concluded adding when the distracting spectacles of this election season are forgotten and the history of our time is written the only important question will be whether or not that new politics came too late cast your monster vote on remake american history maga deus vult	0

seems like the conservative base just decided the very opposite why would you deny reality is trump the most conservative guy out there when it comes to social issues no social issues don seem to be on the top of his list of priorities and just like the vast majority of young to year old conservatives as polls show he probably tends to agree with liberals that it not up to the government to decide which interpretation of christian values you should adhere to on these issues but on all the other issues trump is offering the first real conservative alternative for neoconservatism in decades and he often does so by going back to reaganism neocons have always believed that on most issues we the people are too stupid to see the absolute truth of their doctrine so that we should be lied to and then the only way left to still get the base fired up was to take extremist positions on social issues and constantly try to focus on those issues alone it what bush has been doing what romney has been doing and what cruz has been doing here the answer of the gop base no more lies no more neocons	0
they have appointed themselves to establish the direction of conservatism and the gate keepers of reaganism	0
this is the crucial difference between trump on the one hand and mitt and mccain and rubio and cruz on the other hand trump really hates neocons that why the only years he has been registered dem was during the neocon hostile takeover of the gop from to in the meanwhile we ve seen the disastrous results of neocon dc so you cannot but agree with him on this imo to me the only reason why he entered the race is because he saw that if you start to systematically tell the truth about neocons and denounce all of their lies one after the other the base will immediately prefer to return to down-to-earth reaganism and in this way the power grip of the neocon ideologues will finally be broken and the grand old party finally be back social issues may define whether you re on these issues liberal or conservative but they ve never defined whether you re dem or republican	0
cruz will soon become irrelevant and that how it should be he an establishment neocon trying to use social issues in order to hide his real policies and record and now imitating trump platform in order to hand trump voters back to the gope once they manage to destroy trump at least rubio does not hide that he an establishment neocon republican this election is about the very soul of the republican party which means reaganism trump versus neocons all the other candidates so we need debate between an out of the closet neocon rubio cruz kasich it doesn matter who and trump	0
some truth and some not can get into all of it time constraints but you could say obama was spawned out of reaganism and so is the border control could also go on about levin some respect and less and less not but please don take my word for it listen to what happened to your educational system listen to what this lady wants to say about reagan yea picking up seats doesn do much with what we have now so he just reminded us that republican control is as sh as any other party this is just the tip of the iceberg when person talks only of the good of some which is distorted the speech is biased synynom of being equal to false charlotte iserbyt the secret history of western education full documentary	0
levin has given cover to the dems for years with his foul mouth so is the wrong bird to be preaching ownership of reaganism he ll defend lying which is worse because teddy does it all the time if cruz used foul language levin beck and limbaugh would praise it these types are the conservative closet rot that fear trump gotta lose them	0
don dislike the bushes but between them they are the reason reaganism died in the republican party so screw em	0
the media only gets away with this if we allowed them to am still supporter of gov palins she was perfect candidate that was why the media and the rinos went to extreme efforts to destroy her and they failed the landslide victory of was due lot of gov palin more than of the candidates she endorsed and campaigned for won their elections in the biggest landslide off year election in more than years the only person that stopped palin in the end was herself when she decided not to run in think she or her family were threatened or she just didn have the money needed but she still had major support and most of that support has transferred to trump in the movement that trump is now leading has been growing since and bush pivot away from reaganism and too nwo it jumped to other people at one time or another like perot or buchanan but it solidified on palin in the only reason voted for mccain in was palin after the attacks on her and the tea party in through and and many people stayed home and didn vote for mitt since his group was one of the main attackers and still are against the national limited government movement it was seen again in when the gop was given the senate now trump has the money and the desire to lead the movement this is why they can do full palin on trump because he has enough money to push back	0
the gop consists of elected members and an ideology trump is politically vapid cult of personality figure he brings no ideology with which to replace reaganism his followers just don have the education or intellectual capacity to understand the difference but those who control the party do and they will defend the party against this one off-cult of personality figure who will lose the general election if he the nominee then take his politically confused followers with him	0
trump is third party candidate who successfully used the power of the republican party to enlarge his candidacy for the rnc this is above all lesson in the potentially fatal flaws in the primary election rules if reaganism survives this assault the party will run the primaries very differently four years from now trump is politically vapid cult-of-personality-candidate who offers ideas that are anathema to conservatives and while he picking up some endorsements they don actually mean he developing wing in the party christie and sessions et al are just opportunists their ideas about the economy foreign policy import taxes eminent domain for private use socialized healthcare they all remain classically conservative on those issues reagan remade the party in his image because he brought set of powerful and new ideas trump brings nothing with which to replace those ideas all of which means that trump is most likely temporary phenomenon rather than permanent change to the republican party reaganism if he the nominee the party will likely put all it support behind republican congressional candidates and not even mention trump on local slates they far prefer trump lose and damaged hillary win he leaves the scene along with his followers and the rnc makes sure real conservative wins the nomination next time	0
don think that it trump task to unify the party candidate has to unify the country and once that the case those in the party who agree with him can work with him and the others have the choice between losing their job or adapting to new reality after all that what happened in it was the first big victory for totally new wing of the grand old party those who called themselves neocons since then neocons have managed to completely take over the party and the establisment getting rid of most other versions of republicanism what trump is doing today is destroying that two-decade long neocon takeover and taking the party back to very different kind of conservatism reaganism he has shown how incoherent and dangerous the neocon ideology has been both for the party and the country and the base and lot of people who precisely because of the way the neocons think and have behaved has responded to his message and is now putting the entire party on different course away from neoconservatism the ideology that cruz and kasich continue to defend even when cruz has been hiding that fact for months now and trying to imitate trump platform you can unite mutually exclusive versions of conservatism such as neoconservatism and reaganism either the one dominates the party or the other boehner call for unification is nothing but the desperate clinging to power of neocon who knows that the game is over for him	0
reagan style in what sense if you look at their policies neocons are really new version of conservatism toally different than reaganism just one example taxes reagan has raised them for people like trump and romney because as reagan conservative that what you do when you have debt and deficit to pay off neocons constantly lowered taxes for the wealthiest americans even during times of war and record debts and deficits and before cruz started to imitate trump policies truly reagan policies he has always defended neocon policies too and continues to do so in part it because trump is breaking the power of the neocons in dc and going back to reagan conservatism that the neocon establishment is so mad at him cruz on the other hand continues to follow typical neocon strategies focus on social issues in your campaign so that people won pay too much attention to your other policies the problem is that the country is evolving on social issues today studies show for instance that of conservatives believe cruz ideas on social issues are too extreme and don share them that why his ceiling is and will always be	0
not going to all of sudden like the guy you know but he decided to run and happened to have to run against trump so like all the others he tried out the same talking points in order to see if he ould win the difference between him and the others is that he was smart enough to leave as soon as it became clear that he wouldn win and most of all that today he understands why trump is winning listen to his press conference speech and you ll see that he really getting it and decided to help can he be of some help yes of course trumps needs big coalition to win the general elections and his priority now is to get rid of the crubio boys so having someone like christie who eloquent and was never convinced of the two neocon senators destroying them while you can focus on the next step is certainly useful so ll take that remember this is big difference between neoconservatism and reaganism neoconservatives are first of all ideologues who may even deny the facts if they seem to contradict their theory so for them it all about ideological purity you re either for or against them rreagan conservatives however are much more pragmatic to them what matters is that progress can be made so that the country can take more conservative direction step after step and for each step to be accomplished you need to temporarily team up with someone who potentially for very different reasons is interested in taking that step too that actually the only way to concretely deliver results for your base in congress so that why support trump and think that having christie on board is really nice even when continue to disagree with him on many other issues of course what important is that everybody is being honest about what we agree and disagree about whereas neocons will constantly lie in order to claim that in real life totally nonexistent ideological purity as cruz and rubio are doing today	0
neocons will never support reaganism but many ordinary politicians probably just support neocon policies because their bosses told them to do so so these are the guys that could massively go to trump once they understand that the power of the neocons has been broken and that they won come back	0
let not blame kagan for not getting it today pundits often aren paid at all to take step back and try to understand the most profound and important movements in society they re obliged to produce new article almost each and every day as consequence they cannot but stay stuck in the past that clearly the case with kagan too all we can hope for is that now that trump is destroying neoconservatism and bringing the party back to down-to-earth reaganism all while handing it over to the base again liars such as fox news will disappear because they won be profitable anymore and new media will arise that once again valorize real reflection and critical thought and for this reason decide to invest in serious journalism again go trump let bring that grand old party back	0
not enough voters interviewed and very high margin of error conclusion this polls is worthless but cruz ending up being fourth and trump first is what other polls show too so that probably correct and it how it should be we need one openly neocon candidate and one reaganism candidate kasich has more experience than rubio but the gope is pushing rubio because they believe hispanics will fall for him in the end it not that important so kasich or rubio should stay in the race and on the reaganism side there only trump the other candidates will soon become irrelevant even if they may occasionally win one or the other state	0
exactly that what these guys refused to admit cruz included the reason trump proposals are so revolutionary is precisely because they re achieving nothing less than big return to down-to-earth reagan conservatism whereas one of the biggest neocon lies was the idea that they actually liked reaganism	0
don think so or rather believe they hate him as person because he has no integrity nor loyalty and is constantly lying but when you look at his career you see he been bush employee and you really have to belong to the gop establishment to get into that circle and has access to all the same big donors as bush and he has always defended neocon ideas just like bush being anti-establishment does not mean saying no to every bill in congress because then mark levin will give you high cr score it means really proposing policies that go against what the current neocon gope is constantly imposing on the party and again staying republican but being anti-neocon means supporting reaganism and when it comes to policies only trump is having the guts to do so today	0
many republicans seem to have forgotten it but this is precisely one of the things reaganism has been all about reagan expanded medicare and medicaid that the very opposite of what totally new version of conservatism neocons claim conservatism should do as neocons for two decades now constantly want to get rid of social security and in an economical system that is entirely rigged where only the elite has increasing wages because they pay career politicians to get things like that not because all of sudden they re working much harder or workers are working much less and neocon doctrine created the worst recession since the great depression getting rid of ss would be the worst thing to do this is one of the things that allowed reagan to be elected and it will certainly help trump in the general election continue to be impressed by the fact that he has the guts to call out neocons and to go against their power structure and go back to reagan conservatism no republican has been able to do so for more than two decades let alone to do so and become the nominee and this is what the gop urgently needed in order to stay relevant and become the grand old party again	0
if trump marks the end of the elder george bush dissing of reaganism continued by george then it suits me just fine win or lose when bush decried voodoo economics and promised kinder gentler presidency he stabbed reagan in the back and have been disenfranchised republican ever since these wienies who seek adulation and acceptance from our political and philosophical enemies including their propaganda machine the press merit no respect from them or from me they are stupid fools	0
finally the bushes will be remembered with just deserts their clandestine approach to reversing reaganism makes them the worst offense to the republican party in history big government war mongers globalists	0
who are you kidding the rest of the party left reaganism long long long ago	0
don know who these so called republican voters are that support pro union protectionism trump is not movement he singular cult of personality but the rest of the party is built from reaganism and once he gone they ll still be there trying to pick up the pieces and start moving uphill again last time after goldwater it took generation to capture the congress	0
they re not labels they re ideologies and trumpoids are oblivious to the ideological basis of reaganism so they re in no position to judge what the party is about that why they embrace pro-union ideas about protectionism that have no place in the republican party heck even the dems dropped protectionist ideas after jimmy carter few people remember why so many dems started voting republican in the and it was because george mcgovern had wrecked the party they had button for it- didn leave my party my party left me if trumpoids succeed in wrecking the gop millions of voters will move over to the dems that what happened after goldwater and the repubs didn capture the house for thirty years after that trumpoids lemmings and after he gets destroyed in national eclection he ll be gone and they ll have nothing	0
the sentiments and resentments trump has stirred up do certainly seem to have at least plurality support in the gop and mainly for the reasons you cite people being fed up by what they perceive to be either republican inaction or outright betrayal nationwide such sentiments probably enjoy significant minority support but trumpism has neither the moral grounding nor the philosophical coherence of reaganism and as such will prove to be short-lived movement and trump himself is clearly not true-believer in trumpism he is con man who will pivot to the radical center on actual positions in the general all the while disguising that fact by running nasty campaign against hillary many will applaud his albeit deserved vulgar mocking of clinton and will simply ignore look the other way or maybe not even notice the fact that nominee trump has changed back into his normal moderate suit and ditched the right-wing firebrand costume he wore to secure the nomination	0
to liberals and progressives who are chuckling at the growing crowd of presidential hopefuls some from the very bottom of its barrel of bloviators like donald trump who seem like nothing so much as unwanted fleas at disorganized flea circus say this br br this mostly clueless crew suggest that the republican party is in better shape as democratic setup than the democrats since by their sheer numbers they all raise this obvious question why do the democrats have so few contenders for the presidency br br also these candidates will all have differing messages the republican party has needed new public face since the bush jr era neo-con john wayne tough guy policy fa ade has collapsed due to the iraq war debacle br br among their messages there may be one that voters will really connect with presto new republican scam that will last decades like reaganism br br finally if you re devout republican you never have to think because you have an ideology whose basic tenets are living life of gross self-aggrandizement the public be damned and making as much money as you can whenever you can and protecting that money and your property from taxation br br all the other republican speechifying gas the religious talk the family values prattle etc is icing on that basic cake of rapacious values so even an unscrupulous scoundrel like trump might add another layer of delusional icing to the sagging confection	0

clinton perv but in all fairness trump has been rumored to have participated in epstein sex parties too and has flown on epstein jet he also has bed on his jet which sure is used for his trists think these sexual perversions are common among the rich and famous remember when rush trumps good buddy was busted by customs with bunch of viagra after returning from sex junket to honduras which is notorious for it child sex trade they re all sickos and sure we ll be getting earful in the next months	0
what these clowns meygan will never ask hillary is if her adultrous husband represent security risk for the united states in his unvetted trists with everything from interns to porn stars and prostitutes and how can she insure the security of this country given that she wasn even able to secure her e-mail servers and top secret correspondence	0
he must use it the ones that don care that he had flings or serious sexual trists while married to hill if they have one ounce of morals the pedophile link is critical to show them just who bill clinton is	0
you are implying kasich is establishment or is he in fact establishment again have not done much research into kasich am not here to specifically attack cruzbama and rubiobama neither one qualify for the presidency they are insignificant and the only reason they are on my radar is because of their foreign births and split allegiances which might add was precedence that the establishment with obola and the whole natural born citizen and constitutional law situation	1
last nights debate was obviously coordinated attack but trump held his own for the most up until the trump university situation cruzbama and rubiobama were more focused on attack and had very little to say beyond canned responses and lot to say when it came to playing the he said she said blame game we do not need hormone raging kiddies in the white house some flexibility is warranted in making decision outside of negotiations with terrorists the only person that actually stood out is kasich he stuck to his core beliefs and his core agenda kasich didn bite on the poisoned apple of the he said she said attack game that garnered lot of respect from me trump kasich ticket would be good combination trumps business savvy combined with kasich ability to balance the books aka ceo and the cfo think they can fix lot of the financial and employment issues off the get go	1

rubiobama is shaping up to be romney get ready for more years if we don unite to make america great again	1
am not hard core trump bot actually thought cruz was the best shot for long time but you and people in general have no idea what he said off the record so saying he lied is simply an empty silly comment the times hates him and they are clearly not his friends my year old son knows that your thinking is childish all americans should respect man who sticks to his guns and keeps his sources confidential saying that someone lied about their future plans with nothing to back up those words other than accusations from enemies makes you look foolish and people can take anything you say seriously if he betrays confidential conversation the damage could be irreparable rubiobama and the canadian cruiser and kasich would have to release all their off the record back room conversations they wouldn want to do that would they think first research second write third	1
hopefully we are smart enough now to not elect another rubiobama or cruzbama or bushbama	1

dwight don disagree with you overall at all milo is way out there and way beyond edgy but he is also able to tailor himself to his audience however he was feted at the rnc and diamond and silk and lots of trumpers love him and we actually can be something of big tent without selling out our core principles if you read the piece you find there are lot of different groups in the alt-right discovered natural conservative this group wants to preserve the best of western civilization and culture absolutely do also believe in chivalry men and women being different respect for barriers no transgender bathroom laws and btw transgenderism is psychosis it is not an actual physical problem the surgery can correct etc but believe the edgier parts of the movement serve real purpose and get the left goat in way that we don don want or need to see and hear it all so think you and are more on the same page here than not	0

you can hear the level of moral superiority this guy feels towards the rank and file trump supporters who represent the workers in this country not only does he assume the position of moral superiority but you can read how fascist he is republicans have to be taught lesson because they cannot nominate man so manifestly unqualified to be president in any way shape or form he is the moral authority and apparently he wants to seek revenge towards anyone who defies his ideas or beliefs think the trumpers and trumpettes need to take the same position against this a$$hole and the leftist fellow travelers who mindlesslynod their heads in agreement to anything that comes out of the mouth of leftie	0
if they give either candidate from the left their vote they do no intelligent life form looks at the republican party and sees actual conservatives only die-hard religionists still cling to the myth cruz is anything but that leaves rinos still pretending and milking ignorants of the true unicorn fairytale they are complicate with the leftists they all have to be there is no cash they ve squandered it all taking globalists cash is the only way they can continue to cash out the rest no trumpers stupid enough to continue with the ruling elite are either invested in the downfall or crazy ignorants still letting abortion wag the dog and will inevitably be the votes that lead us to war and yes to extermination	0

it is my belief that the democrats have vastly overplayed khan the never trumpers and the media loves it it is galling as vietnam era vet to see this muslim act all high and mighty muslim are at war with the world the last thing most people want to hear from them is that we have not served khan is using his dead son as prop it get old quick the media narrative is old news	0
trump loss combined with this epic tantrum really will have an effect the shine is off trumpers	0
bah politics is all legal it seems carson supporter don like what cruz did but still catch lot of trumpers spewing hate so their sudden indignation sickens me so ll keep calling them on it	0

it all big conspiracy right you trumpers really are leftists	0
highly doubtful nobody but butt hurt trumpers cares did cnn fire anyone it is their fault	0
you trumpers are obsessed with the birther issue must be an iq issue cruz is not viable because he preached and then lied about carson	0
you are not the only one here some trumpers love the insults and they are only valuable to point	0
oh the irony of this post let see trump is destroying the establishment we don need more establishment types like dole dole endorses trump oh you trumpers are good for laugh	0
ll run circles around any trumpers here but that not difficult most trumpers are ignorant trailer dwellers so it is no challenge but entertainment for me	0
right like ben carson lot but it was really dumb to let it be known during caucusing that you wouldn be going to nh or sc to campaign but it doesn matter to the trumpers they don give one crap about carson they have an excuse to explain why trump lost instead of focusing on his lack of organization in the state as he said or skipping the debate they focus on something minor	0
trumpers will bash their own mothers for trump	0
well it is right in his book in his own words how he lied multiple times to get ahead storm trumpers just don care he could shoot one and they would consider it an honor	0

let the racist avalanche of comments commence gotta love trumpers	0
but that evil corrupt old bag is ok with your dumb-as-a-box-of-rocks never trumpers get your head out of your ass	0
never trumpers are all tied up in knots	0
completely agree with what you said here not only is the violence wrong but it also counterproductive as it allows trumpers to position themselves into their favorite one victim it no coincidence that all the violence is centered around trump though given his needlessly inflammatory rhetoric	0
it obvious these never trumpers mobs are orchestrated by mitt romney glen beck and mark levin	0
just went there to see what they thought about the violence in san jose they re actually kind of mixed some blaming trump of course but some are supportive of the woman and really railed on the soros backed thugs get the impression another round of never trumpers is going to bail after all this	0
it obvious these mobs are never trumpers lead by mitt romney glen beck and mark levin	0
are all never trumpers as mysoginistic woman haters as this guy	0
these never trumpers have become full blown leftists and should be regarded as the same	0
still think trumpers and anti-trumpers should be given an arena to punch it out it in only willing participants of course and televise the matches	0
ben howe is obviusly delusional-irrational in his hate of trump to him trump is the devil and he can not comprehend reasonable people concerned for their country as he is have opted for trump kristol howe and the liberals are all foaming at the mouth because they are dogmatics can only tolerate different polical options as long as it coincides with their option which obviously rs the revealed truth it is funny how fundamentalist religious thinking is in the bones of so anti trump odd how moslem fundamentalists and anti trumpers share fundamentalist intolerance	0
these idiots never trumpers have gone full leftist	0
it obvious these never trumpers mobs are orchestrated by mitt romney glenn beck and mark levin	0
don have any numbers but the never trumpers seem to be localized don think they are that wide spread	0
correct my hunch is that leftists assumed that low iq redneck ignorant hs grads trumpers would respond in kind with violence in response to the attacks surpise you arrogant progressive snobs have made series of ill informed assumption for the past year the assumption that trumpers will respond to violence or that we will ever find it acceptable to give up our right to free speech will be your undoing people see your angry mobs of desperate third worlders who respond to dissent with violence because they are low iq conditioned mad dogs even those who despise trump for his brash behavior will elect him to avoid future with more of this lawlessness violence and suppression of free speech we have been country of many colors for so long because we used to be able to agree to disagree country without borders and laws is not country and electing hillary will put this once fine independent nation on the auction block to the highest bidder for her personal gain	0
waiting for trumpers to defend themselves and or retaliate please everyone continue to hold your anger in check but could you imagine the looks on the protesters faces if they suddenly got pelted with rotten eggs and bags of dog sht	0
right on every count amen trump supporters gather here we are friendly support group all trumpers are welcome	0
am curious which candidate aside from maybe rubio would have had better chance and yes you are supporting hillary romney would have been my th choice but pulled lever for willard so would not help barack kasich had no chance too similar to hillary and if he campaign were on trumpsters sitting out maybe some would have but we don have that problem the never trumpers have the decision that the rest of us have had for many cycles to chose someone we don particularly like to stop the other side sorry you don like trump but did not like bush dole bush bush mccain romney but voted for each of them would you have preferred voted dukakis clinton clinton gore kerry bo bo according to the never trumpers should have voted for the democrats because don like trump and my guy lost you establishment guys get to take one for the team like the millions like me who supported your beta male candidates of the past romney clinched he nomination with plurality similar to trump with much smaller field this country need new thinking and ideas both sides have failed so badly an alertnative method must be tried sorry you don like trump and he is not going to reach out to you either your movement has aligned with the left to knee cap trump at every turn and your efforts have backfired so far	0
so you never trumpers by default are endorsing hillary if trump had gone to the convention with plurality but not majority and had not been nominated most of you trumpsters would have sat out the election and endorsed hillary by default trump is polarizing and his run for the presidency has insured dem victory don think cruz had chance either but several of the other candidates would have	0
who do you suggest cruz he could not capture of the vote in florida ohio pennsylvania with reduced fields how would he compete on national level and his top surrogate cheeto beck would really be ramping it up now and turning off all potential swing voters would jeb be better maybe lindsay if only given chance could do it so you never trumpers by default are endorsing hillary and your leaders kristol ect would prefer this	0
course you don god can wait for the landslide loss in november and the collective shock of idiot trumpers	0
it the never ending leftist propaganda meant to prop up libbies feelings and and try to make us trumpers quake with fear but it not working on us	0
the more violent the anti trumpers the more votes trump is going to receive	0
lot of trumpers are riled up about cruz guess they see him as an existential threat to trump candidacy they are correct cruz is going to win	0
and the trumpers start to sweat as he back tracks on immigration no better than rubio	0
we told em and we told em and we told and now they must endure trump telling them that we were right all along trumps dishonesty here is yuugee and it is going to piss good number of people off trumpers ought to just try truth it works better	0
trump just left the trumpets hanging big time trump just pulled me too that is because the whole trump campaign has been one of projection and the needed exposure of it came to light bigtime tonight in many many ways we told trumpets so it really is cruz or lose or you folks can elect guy who wrote checks to hillary for president campaign trumpers must be sooooo proud or something	0
don you just love how bb hides this yyuuggee story never before touted directly on the campaign trail that we have seen especially this specifically in tiny no picture bit but trumps talking about his weiner size gets big play gotta cut the trumpers some slack this one is pretty hard for them to spin so in typical liberal fashion they attempt to see it dumped down the memory hole andrew would have called this front and center story and you guys know it how can trump sit across from hillary and defend against hillary saying donald you said would make great president and you wrote four different checks to my presidential campaign how can you sit there now and say should not be elected now listen folks you cannot beat democrats by joining democrats stop being conned into supporting who the democrats are voting for they are voting undeniably for trump abandon trump his candidacy is duck mission literally and figuratively cruz or lose	0
enjoy your win trumpers if he loses to hillary it on you we cruzers are going libertarian and it your douchebaggery that ever prevents the party unity behind trump	0
dwarves cruzers can fight with the elves trumpers to defeat sauron it happened before	0
sure that fine he knocked off opponents on very low odds good for him but didn have to wait long for the trumpers to tell me to line up behind the nominee and that is hilarious but this is what happens to people in the throes of idol worship see whatever the idol does is good there are no principles so if you want to burn it down one day and line up the next we re just not supposed to notice ah well at least laughing	0
hahahaha someone just upthread told me go to poor trumpers lol	0
thank you posts like this remind me why not having anything to do with trump or trumpers	0
if he is everything you say he is you should vote for him seriously you could destroy him from inside of his own camp and the trumpers are so stupid we wouldn even notice right that blew them up	0
colin powell put out statement to the never trumpers he pointed out the ages of the supreme court justices and said the next president may end up appointing as many as five new justices in the next years hillary has already said she wants to get rid of the heller decision and do away with he said republicans may have chance to have supreme court and if we lose to hillary the scotus will be in democrat hands for whole generation he says to think about what you are saying before you say you won vote for the republican nominee	0
think you should take day off before giving that theory legs it been long ass year but wonder do you think the gop is smart enough to hatch plan throw everything they have at trump right alongside over half the media never trumpers and diehard cruz supporters and throw their support behind man they despise just to get trump the nomination so he could fail	0
if trump had lost and cruz had won would have still voted for him over hillary it shame the idiot never trumpers hate america	0
there is huge difference between trump supporters that threatened to vote against the party vs the never trump people the trump supporters were not going accept the party swindling the election vs the never trumpers who are just acting like spoiled brats because they lost fair square	0
glad trump is so dominant he can afford to lose the never trumpers there aren enough of them to make difference	0

however still agreed to play along didn sure after doing what you later claimed you didn what exactly am deflecting by pointing out you deflected the question asked regarding christians in this country and instead asked me to look at other countries in order to dispel slippery slope argument that never made to begin with christianity and christians have not attempted to establish theocracies in any country where they dominate you can dispute that either can and have it also irrelevant to what we were discussing there hmmm yes it was all the doing of those rascally christians that probably why it passed with overwhelming support from all sorts of californians blacks for example supported it to the tune of something like as recall first of all it passed with simple majority just over if

opposed interracial marriages before those despicable activist liberal judges threw those laws out know going to have to explain the logic of this analogy to you like child later and that fine do you even know why the th amendment was necessary in the first place poindexter race hey look another shifting argument in your original comment you mentioned nothing about the historical context in which the amendment was passed in fact you were quite adamant that the interpretation should be limited strictly to the verbatim language contained therein only when pointed out that such language wasn even there to begin with in other words that you don know what you re talking about did you change your tune to why it was necessary how you feel qualified to discuss court case when you don even know what in the amendment that was used to argue it is beyond me although not surprising bottom line though don particularly have dog in the fight about race and genetics silliness that you re barfing up here it was your argument simply pointed out that once again you don know what you re talking about with regards to race and genetics what is the standard we are to use then fragout hmmmm it seems to me that declaration of love is about all that necessary now love is irrelevant states don test for love before issuing marriage licences and it certainly isn required and never has been historically speaking love is fairly new development in the arrangement of marriage in any case limiting marriage to consenting adults of human personhood implied where no legitimate state interest exists in prohibiting it sounds pretty good to me as to your assertion about your support for polygamy well how very open minded of you be careful that your brains don fall out don think the one that needs to worry about that given the research on intolerance and lower iq scores the relevant clause there is one man and one woman of the same race you can dismiss that last part if you want to but that doesn make it lose relevance nor does it change the fact that the definition was different just years ago ah should ve anticipated that you pull this old chestnut out of the fire when losing resort to rhetoric that attempts to paint your opponent as some sort of unreconstructed racist or bigot have to admit that it been comical watching you try and get handle on logical fallacies it almost like you have list of them there and when you get to point in the conversation where you don know what to do or when someone points out logical hole you didn see before you just toss one of them out there and see if it sticks unfortunately it not begging the question it not red herring either it actually pretty simple if-then logic which ll try to explain in such way that even you can understand as part of your argument for why marriage should be limited to man woman couples you claimed that there is extremely longstanding cultural and moral basis upon which to rest case against the concept of gay marriage now if having an extremely longstanding cultural and moral basis makes thing worthy of being preserved then all things that meet that criteria must also be worthy of being preserved since slavery had for long time an extremely longstanding cultural and moral basis slavery must also be worthy of being preserved according to your own logic contrary to what you claim did not point this out to you in order to try and paint you as racist or bigot know that you don support slavery that the point if someone suggested to you that we should repeal the th amendment so we could own slaves again you wouldn say well there was an extremely longstanding cultural and moral basis for slavery so let do it and if someone presented that argument to you in favor of it you would undoubtedly reject it and yet you re trying to use that same argument here let be clear about something here it was predominantly american christians who led the fight against slavery very true they also led the fight to preserve it as well quoting the bible as justification in the process the constitution itself is utterly silent on the issue of marriage it doesn say anything about privacy either but ll bet that you don support the government reading your mail or putting cameras in your home rights needn be listed verbatim in the constitution to exist since the constitution doesn grant them in the first place as it plainly states in the th amendment because living constitution and all that right right yeah that right look get it you re conservative you deal in rigid thinking and loathe ambiguity there some really interesting research in this field and so can see how malleable constitution might frighten you but it better than having rigid th century document and trying to apply it to modern society the question was whether gay marriage was required by our constitution no it wasn although it doesn surprise me that you don know what you re talking about here either it most certainly is not that simple you sophist simply saying it isn doesn make it so over and over and over again you reveal that the real burr in your saddle is christianity and christians you want to accuse me of being bigot you made comment to which responded don get butthurt just because you don like the answer and if thinking it immoral to murder of the world population by drowning to include numerous children both born and unborn makes me bigot then so be it it doesn people like me are not dying out bubba in terms of people who oppose ssm yes you most certainly are public perception over this hasn waxed and waned there are small fluctuations but if you plot the quarter century worth of data on graph you see nice upwards trend the reason for this is obvious particularly given the overwhelming support among those under as said before they re slowly replacing people like you that not to say that opponents to ssm will totally disappear years removed from the loving decision there are still minority that think black people shouldn marry white people not surprisingly mostly older people but thankfully they re an irrelevant minority who think it fair to say that most people feel are bigoted bygones of the past there every indication that this is the fate that awaits the ssm opponent you made the claim that god is not mentioned in our constitution technically that not true ah you mean that formal method of writing the date that appeared in other documents of the era independently of any religious implications there was no urgent moral imperative with the question of gay marriage as there was with loving that both debatable and irrelevant to the fact that both cases are incredibly similar and that if one is unconstitional then so is the other they aren supposed to create legislation from the bench that what they did in both of those cases when people like you say things like this have to wonder how you ever made it out of high school did civics get cut in whatever underfunded public school system you attended you implied it deny it if you want but that the logical end point of your assertion no really didn this is partly my fault here you ve demonstrated in our conversations that must spell things out for you very plainly and not leave anything up to your atrocious reasoning and reading comprehension skills so let me break this down for you as well so that hopefully you can grasp it you claimed that christian-based laws could not get passed because they would be opposed by liberals simply pointed out the fact that in some places where such laws would be and have been passed there exists too few liberals to oppose it successfully in the first place the only inference to be made there is your conclusion is faulty and here is why didn spell this out for you verbatim which was obviously my mistake ll make an effort to break things down in the future so that you don drag the conversation off on some wild tangent have things to do and the rest of your comment doesn look particularly important so will skip responding to it for now happy holidays	0
then why type the prior paragraph in the first place why not wanted to express my opinion think your poll sources are bunch of prog-tard tw ts however still agreed to play along didn pay attention because this is what deflection looks like what exactly am deflecting by pointing out that numerous western democracies have official long established christian state religions or state churches and it hasn led to the slippery slope of theocracy that you re implying would happen in america if we pesky christians were able to accomplish the same thing in individual states or at the federal level seems relevant enough to me fragout you just don like having your nose rubbed in it you ve made it habit of requiring me to copy and paste your own comments to you and you ve made habit of either deliberately or through your own lack of reading comprehension to distort what have said islam has indeed established theocracies everywhere it dominant you simply can dispute that christianity and christians have not attempted to establish theocracies in any country where they dominate you can dispute that either islam may very well wish to establish theocracy in america but they will not be able to achieve that goal being as they re only about of america population confidently assert that they pose little serious threat of being able to impose an islamic theocracy upon us that is not in dispute just look at the entire prop case--who supported it who got it on the ballot who defended it in court--as an example hmmm yes it was all the doing of those rascally christians that probably why it passed with overwhelming support from all sorts of californians blacks for example supported it to the tune of something like as recall you prog-tards didn like that result did you fragout so you went whining and crying and stomping your widdy feets to despicable corrupt gay activist federal judge who cynically and unconstitutionally suspended it thereby thwarting the will of the citizens of the people banana republik of ca how very democratic the sickeningly liberal th circuit court upholding his ruling their opinion which essentially boiled down to saying that prop was essentially unfair made them sound like bunch of year olds was no big surprise that how prog-tards roll though don like the results of democracy just change em what have you even read the th amendment do you even know why the th amendment was necessary in the first place poindexter race because after the civil war it was deemed necessary to explicitly declare that black people everywhere in the united states were entitled to the same rights and protections as every other american citizen the th amendment was all about black people but let move on shall we first let agree to remember that marriage as an institution between one man and one woman significantly pre-dates our constitution and its th amendment second when the th amendment was written homosexual behavior was felony in every state so if the th amendment was intended to encompass gay marriage as the activist social engineers on our sc assert the fact that every state in the union would ve thrown anyone who tried it into the slammer is certainly an odd way to go about implementing that right to equal protection under the law wouldn you agree when the th amendment was passed slaves and women couldn vote however at the time no one tried to use the equal protection clause of the amendment to change the voting rights laws in fact those voting rights discriminations were eventually addressed in the th and th amendments by wait for it convincing the congress and state legislatures through supermajorities to amend the constitution wow they actually used constitutional amendments to achieve their goal instead of cynically relying on lockstep liberal fruitcakes prancing around in wizard robes unconstitutionally legislating from the bench imagine that categorically dispute your obnoxious self-serving assertion that loving and obergefell are legally indistinguishable trust me when tell you that you re way over your head here race is sociological concept trust me when tell you that your prog-tard head is shoved so far up your hopelessly pc rse that it would take surgeon and plumber to remove it ll note couple of things we share over of our dna with chimpanzees but we re nothing at all like them the point being that extremely small percentages of difference within our dna contribute to extremely significant differences and there are extremely small differences in the dna of the human species in addition even if you want to insist that there no genetic difference between races there certainly biological difference not only that but human nature being what it is don see people beliefs about there being different races changing anytime soon bottom line though don particularly have dog in the fight about race and genetics silliness that you re barfing up here tell it to rachel dolezal and shawn king and while we re at it heck ll note that it actually great news fragout it means that we can do away with the nonsense of affirmative action no and don think any reasonable person would claim that the scotus was infallible however once again you ve made point that irrelevant to the discussion at hand no haven that your opinion which you re welcome to assert that it completely relevant and applicable to your behavior and attitude firstly don know who claimed that love is the only standard we are to consider because it wasn me what is the standard we are to use then fragout hmmmm it seems to me that declaration of love is about all that necessary now however if you ve got good suggestion as to another standard or standards that we can apply to determine who should or should not be allowed to participate in the institution of marriage then ahem love to hear them as to your assertion about your support for polygamy well how very open minded of you be careful that your brains don fall out until loving it was one man and one woman of the same race in some places the relevant clause there is one man and one woman which is remarkably consistent with what marriage has traditionally meant for thousands of years in all sorts of societies particularly western societies of which we are branch in the family tree slavery was cultural and moral norm for thousands of years too so do you want to jump behind that cause as well ah should ve anticipated that you pull this old chestnut out of the fire when losing resort to rhetoric that attempts to paint your opponent as some sort of unreconstructed racist or bigot let be clear about something here it was predominantly american christians who led the fight against slavery but you also need to understand that you re committing grave logical fallacy when you try to use flamingly stupid argument like your slavery comparison it called begging the question which makes you nothing more than cheap sophist you automatically assume that my premise gay marriage shouldn have been implemented by the sc is wrong and that your premise is valid gay marriage as implemented by the sc is right on top of that you then attempt to throw in ringer about slavery that not really meant to do anything except try to distract and try to make me defensive about something have no reason or need to defend myself against have never and would never have supported slavery got it save that sh for the amateurs bub the legal concept in court decision of constitutional right to marriage predated this decision the key words in your sentence are court decision get it the constitution itself is utterly silent on the issue of marriage in other words it only by judicial chicanery and constitutional interpretation that constitutional right to marriage gay or otherwise exists certain that not problem for you as prog-tard because living constitution and all that right right the question before our supreme court was not whether gay marriage was good or bad policy the question was whether gay marriage was required by our constitution they decided to debate and answer the policy question instead of the real legal question because that what five of the activists on the court really wanted then so was loving virginia there was no urgent moral imperative with the question of gay marriage as there was with loving as you yourself noted there are cultural and as noted biological differences between different races of human beings but that about it gay marriage should have been decided by letting it work its way through the various states our laboratories of democracy or by constitutional amendment as it is now all the sc has done is create yet another huge mess akin to the mess they created with the roe wade decision two groups of americans now hate each other you know why because sc judges aren supposed to be activists and social engineers they aren supposed to create legislation from the bench that what they did in both of those cases wonder if you realize that you just admitted to wanting to do exactly what you denied people are doing if you want to use the bible as legal guide then you want to live in theocracy it that simple it most certainly is not that simple you sophist furthermore the bible is horrible moral compass over and over and over again you reveal that the real burr in your saddle is christianity and christians you want to accuse me of being bigot that pretty funny rich could go on with examples of the sadistic morality that permeates the bible permeates eh billions of people nearly billion of them in fact beg to differ with you you are distinctly in the minority distinctly never said that we should march in like godzilla you implied it deny it if you want but that the logical end point of your assertion about there not being enough prog-tards in conservative states to withstand the onslaught of all us barbaric conservatives and christians that what you prog-tard ssies do you go running and crying to auntie federal government like tattling little children whenever you don like something conservatives and christians do just sayin sorry if it hurts your widdy feewings know prog-tards are very sensitive truth hurts leaves mark people like you are dying out people like me are not dying out bubba both conservatives and christians outnumber prog-tard secularists like you by huge numbers keep that in mind if you ever get twitchy and want to really start something support of ssm has been steadily increasing since they started polling for it ish years ago zat right such lovely bunch of preening virtue peacocks you are too must say say have you seen these polls you like polls you told me so public perceptions and attitudes wax and wane wouldn get too cocky just yet if were you fragout what are you talking about you made the claim that god is not mentioned in our constitution technically that not true was just schoolin you done in convention by the unanimous consent of the states present the seventeenth day of september in the year of our lord one thousand seven hundred and eighty seven and of the independence of the united states of america good grief getting tired of spanking you sparky going to cherry pick the following few things want to respond to it is when we have the establishment clause the establishment clause is constraint upon the federal government remember it not constraint upon the of american citizens who are christians as noted we have freedom of religion however you and are not guaranteed anywhere in our constitution freedom from religion freedom of religion is deeply affirmative right in favor of an individual right to live there conscience public private civic wherever yep how does that old adage go insults are the last refuge of the out-argued you haven argued particularly well verbosely perhaps but not particularly well you re ok just amusing myself by insulting you it technique to goad you into making mistakes because this discussion began by discussing religions not any old random lobbying group you reeeeeeeeally have chip on your shoulder about christians you should just admit it not although this comment doesn surprise you sure hate to be the one to tell you this as well but some gay people are christian gasp sacre bleu you re kidding what does that have to do with anything injecting their religion into laws and civic institutions is exactly what claimed that they were doing to begin with sort of it is you re also insinuating that means christians seek theocratic government or that any hint of christianity within our civic and legal discourse is the slippery slope to theocracy eeeeeeeeeek you can have one without the other chief do you need me to explain this fundamental concept to you yeah you knock yourself out trying to explain it because what you re asserting is nothing but horse patooty with frosting on it again never said that they were or that that alone would make them as such it exactly what you ve been implying theocracies are nasty nasty business you want to make large numbers of american christians out to be fanatics who would shackle their fellow citizens with theocracy if given half chance you re living in fantasy world as ve already noted christianity does not seek to establish theocracies anywhere in the world where it the dominant religion of culture nowhere that really all you have to know and understand try to cut your christian neighbors and friends little more slack fragout they re not evil they re not out to get you they re not out to trample you under the boot of theocracy they re not once again merry christmas jesus loves curmudgeons too	0

of course it rigged the gop is as much part of the established order as the clinton party as john whitehead says if voting mattered they wouldn let us do it now before some mentally malnourished chucklehead shrieks that what the electoral college does the ec is what keeps low population states like wyoming north dakota montana and other mountain states on the playing field versus huge states like california and new york whose leftist tendencies are antithetical to these states with only ec votes one for each senator and representative instead of bench warmers combined these ecer states still only have fraction of the potus electoral power of california or new york hence they can be safely ignored except in elections as raucous as this one where larger state electoral votes maybe up for grabs popular or proportional voting rules concentrates political power in urban zones as is the case heir ins ze peeples republik von cullyforjna rural counties have little to no voice in sacramento they are occasionally thrown bone by the sf and la cabal when those forces won miss that particular bone but the rural counties are typically told to just shut up and know their place reducing the ec to nothing more than mirror of the nationwide popular vote per the recent movement is methodology to take away what left of these small states potus voting power like whitehead said if voting mattered they wouldn let us do it	0

blockquote actually not so rare blockquote judging from the trump supporters who ve responded by my comments you are extremely rare castle could win without the votes of most of the liberty-loving purists if his message wasn withheld from the all the people with common sense by the demoncrap repugantgoon-controlled media and if those people with common-sense and the purists had the courage of their convictions rather than the manipulated vacuity of conscience of voting for someone the media says you should vote for in contrast to what you mentioned before say when you vote for president you re not just voting for man woman you re voting to be defender or our constitution or traitorous facilitator for the entrenchment of our post-constitutional people banana republik of amerika sure the white obama trump of the animated bag of corrupt maggot butt-puss shrillary rotten clitoris may win but even if they do win too knowing that wasn traitor to the constitution upheld my oath to defend it from domestic enemies trump shrillary and thus didn spit urinate and defecate in the spilled blood of those who made the ultimate sacrifice to establish our once-great but now defunct constitutional republic republic that operated under the precept of the rule of law instead or our current banana republik demonic rule- of-men	0
you are very rare trump supporter one who is articulate and not prone to intellectually vacuous red herrings straw men non-sequiturs and ad hominem-only adolescent twaddle actually there is conservative running darrel castle of the constitution party but so few of his fellow conservatives have the courage of their convictions to vote for him they take the easy convictionless route of only voting for someone who can win but the conservative darrel castle won win not because he not winner but because conservatives don have the courage of their convictions to vote for conservative over non-conservative who can win thus their main objective seems to be to win for their own short-term gratification but at the expense of the long-term destruction of the country that only delusion of winning while actually losing the leftist-dominated repugantgoon party knows this about their spineless useful idiot party loyalist supporters and that is why they ve been able to stay in power even though they work in conjunction with their fellow constitution-contemptuous and leftist demoncraps to continually move the country further toward the entrenchment of our post-constitutional people banana republik of amerika for my thoughts on your scotus argument and if you re real glutton for punishment	0
the so-called impurist conservatives that you say were voted in were not real conservatives by any constitutionally-conservative measure that why put conservative in quote marks but those were the same types running against trump moreover you seem to forget that the potus is much more than one man he she appoints over persons to run the government with all trump faults have no doubt that his appointments will be far superior to any hc would appoint we re talking about an army of foot soldiers here not just general think jeff sessions vs van jones are you really going to argue this is not serious consideration how does voting in leftist demoncrap like trump stop the entrenchment of the people banana republik of amerika don accept the premise trump is not conservative but back to my original point we didn have any running anyway assuming he does what he says then that may slow the entrenchment secure the borders slow immigration stop the faux free-trade deals etc of course you could just sit home and not vote at all reasonable decision given the options or you could waste gas and energy and write in or vote for the libertarian candidate cute but zero impact though voted for cruz in my primary will enthusiastically vote for trump in the general	0
finally coherent response though flawed one the whole premise of your rebuttal is fallacious one that conservatives were voted in by real grassroots conservatives disagree the so-called impurist conservatives that you say were voted in were not real conservatives by any constitutionally-conservative measure to illustrate my point name one of whom the central part of their campaign for office included not only the eradication of unconstitutional obamacare but the eradication of the department of education the epa the department of agriculture the department of energy the office of social innovation and civic participation the farm service agency the irs gestapo and the incomprehensible tax code the office of rural development the minority business development agency the department of education structure the office of postsecondary education the office of vocational and adult education the office of federal student aid the president advisory board on historically black colleges and universities the office of elementary and secondary education the office of migrant education the president advisory commission on educational excellence for hispanic americans the office of innovation and improvement and thousands more banana republik-like unconstitutional deficit increasing enclaves of unelected unaccountable tyrannical bureaucrats in any event how does voting in leftist demoncrap like trump stop the entrenchment of the people banana republik of amerika	0

much hue and cry on the interweb at the revelation that jeremy corbyn once had dalliance with diane abbott in the nineteen seventies as the telegraph story has it the couple reportedly went on tour of east germany together on motorbike way to go jezzer sic but my how he loved that bike it was cranky classic imz-ural cossack in keeping with jeremy beloved russian ideology and he looked after it as if it were delicate child so much so that he always kept small tub of vaseline handy and rubbed it over the thin and delicate soviet chrome-work if it ever threatened to rain that motorcycle was his pride and joy and so enamoured of it was he that he was certain it would also impress dianne parents who he been persuaded to meet on their return from the grand tour of the glorious deutsche demokratische republik the happy couple rattled and bounced along some of london last remaining cobbled streets with diane bum perched proudly around the pillion overhead the skies were gloomy overcast grey rain maybe he thought but not just yet after all his elder brother piers is weatherman and little of the lore had washed off as he parked up he reached for the vaseline but diane interrupted his preparations and pulled him to her she whispered in his ear have to tell you something about my parents before we go in know you like to debate politics around the table but please please don do it tonight when my family eats dinner we don talk jeremy is aghast what other purpose is there in gathering over food but to discuss the burning issues of the day and plot the revolution but diane pleads please seriously don say word and then in whisper she added anybody who speaks during dinner has to do the dishes jeremy nods his assent he quite understands while he was growing up his parents had servants to do all that when they enter the house he is astonished everywhere there are dirty dishes in the hallway is huge stack of unwashed plates and bowls teeter on every step of the stairs in the middle of the living room neat but grubby pile of dishes sits on the coffee table surrounded by tangle of food-encrusted cutlery and then in the kitchen the sink is piled high with dirty crockery there must be dozen dinner services he deduces all unwashed because of some stupid rule jeremy hates rules and decides there and then that when he is prime minister he will abolish them the dining room thankfully is neat and the table formally laid after introductions they take their seats and diane catches jeremy eye she holds finger up to her lips mimes shush and blows him kiss dinner proceeds in total silence save for the sounds of mastication and the occasional gulp and slurp this is bizarre and jeremy ever the rebel decides to see how far they will stick to this ridiculous principle he leans over to diana and plants long deep tonguey kiss on her lips nobody says thing emboldened and curiously aroused he pulls her to her feet and strips her naked then takes her right there on the table in front of her open-mouthed mum and dad still not sound he had already noticed that diane mum was still handsome woman and so amazed at getting no reaction he dismounts di and takes her mother in passionate embrace then he gathers her into the astonishing tableau amid the turnips on the table and proceeds to have frenzied three-way with the two women who although by now both highly aroused still utter not recognisable syllable during all this time the father has said nothing and has look of iron resolve on his poker face he is man of principle and by god he will not give in now jeremy comes up for air and notices the first drops of rain on the dining room window his thoughts immediately fly to his beloved cossack outside in the yard and he leaps off the table and dives for the zip pocket in his leather jacket for moment he looks bereft but then finds what he has been fumbling for he brings out the little jar of vaseline and holds it up whereupon diane dad stands up flings his napkin on the table and shouts out all right all right ll do the effing dishes	0

here is my latest summary mrs clintin always making excuses for not accomplishing any goals asking for rewards for just trying hard really running for president totally based on who her husband is spent year flying around the world with no purpose resulting in the creation of isis and the largest refugee migration since wwii trump when he screws up he says screwed up and moves on concentrates on achieving goals and refuses any accolades unless he actually accomplished goal he is the only candidate in that has any credibility to accomplish any of the goals put forth and in fact is the only candidate that presented the issues americans care about instead of the years old canned bs from the dc politicians bernie has trouble with math not enough gdp to provide funding for all of his wish list freebie jewish guy who bashes jews simply not logical better feminist then mrs clintin cruz bush extended family member who has stolen all of trumps talking points and then lies about trumps positions on those points has trouble finding any christian leader to endorse him case itchy resented the fact that his father was mailman he has never gotten over it	0
bernie is better feminist then mrs clintin	0
that thing is traitor sincerely hope it implicates hillary directly gives up secret password to its lawyer to open the one document implicating hildascum in actually ordering hits on her political enrmirs naming names and dates of confirmed kills then that hideous thing in prison can hang itself drag it body diwn flights of steos go shopping on video at walmart while still hanging from pole and magically find gun and shoot itself times in the head for perfect clintin suicide if this country is so bad try pakistan guess what happens to traitors there	0
yea they kept coming that how my grandparents got here they had to wait for verification of where they came from before they were allowed to get on the boat they had to have physicals on ellis island to keep contagious diseases from spreading they accepted and loved this country and their number one priority was to assimilate not to ignore the rule of law and commit crimes and kill christians you are such an arrogant and ignorant elite minded christophobic reprobate re starting to believe your own lies you only say this stuff to bring in more muslooms so who is the hater you hate christians and you hate the culture this country has taken years to develop anyone who is not for trump is supporting mrs clintin and are obviously haters democrats and anyone else not supporting trump is hater hater of america unborn children gays american workers old people free speech truth global respect vets christians safe society coal miners steel workers manufacturing people being self sufficient with energy legal gun owners who protect their families and yes hater of reality	0
it is just so difficult to get my head around the fact that there are about of the citizens of this country who are so illiterate and dysfunctional that they have said they will vote for mrs clintin how can country have so many idiots willing to vote for the most corrupt and disgusting humen being to ever run for president	0
the lie that we can survive with zero population growth is one of the ingredients to continue to allow illegal immigrants to flow into the country for the real purpose of diluting the workforce and keeping wages down fix the out of control immigration problem and our standard of living will rise want an example china prohibited more than one child per couple and their economy boomed for years so population growth is not directly proportional to economic growth couple that with the fact that the obamo clintin administration are the most hateful people on the face of the earth and have conspired to screw as many americans as possible	0
think about it there are several months until the election and the dems and their lap dog media are going insane as though trump has already won so say trump needs to act like he won and stop being polite to these bottom feeders in fact he should only give interviews to hanity gretta and diamond silk in addition to them he can be interviewed by his own people and have the interview gleaned and released on video to prevent the hatchet jobs by msnbc and cnn and the other lying corrupt racist bigoted news stations who hate americans that actually think for themselves the ultimate weapon is to restrict their access to him look mrs clintin has not done single real interview or answered single question for the last year and the media and her minions still think she is some genious politician when all she is is lying corrupt political hack	0
not defending either clintin but it funny how rape accusations against him are more detrimental to her than they were to him	0
clintin had to be of violent nature to allow benghazi deaths so casually or any other deaths	0
clintin mentality speaks again not just from the rioters	0
so even the people who refused to ignore the media hate speech against trump finally understand that hillry is incompetent and unqualified to do anything except steal money to sell out the country hillry has been in politics for over years starting with the nixon trials and she can stand up and talk about issues for an hour without cheating like drug addict in college but she remembers that we only have minutes to respond to nuke attack mrs bill clintin has no intelligence no competence no judgment no ability to discern reality from fiction no integrity no credibility no short term memory no organizational skills no communication skills no cognitive abilities no regard for life no concern for this country no empathy for anyone no time to defend our culture no ability to stop lying about everything no chance of becoming president without wide spread voter fraud read my lips no more bush and no more clintins go vote trump pence	0
statements of why would any woman vote for mrs bill clintin instead of trump hillry has vagina hillry reminds them of their sick old grandmother hillry put up with bill for all those years just so she could be doing this so she deserves it hillry figured out how to sell this countries resources like uranium to make nukes and access to us markets and only acquired several hundred million dollars in the process so that just smart business person destroying all the emails and other evidence referencing these deals was just smart politics trump has said some mean things to people that have attacked him during the last years of his life running billion dollar business the media even put out commercial and cataloged all they could find which was about people over years big deal trump actually has personality and the self confidence to not apologize for things he said that are true but uncomfortable and not pc like the teachings and the ideology of islam hates western culture and hates america trump will actually use the natural resources of this country that god gave us to get us out of debt and create level playing field with the international manufacturing market to give decent salaries to american workers this infuriates globalists who want us to become enslaved to the rest of the world by driving the national debt beyond sustainability as sovereign nation trump will provide common sense approaches to issues of health care job creation tax reduction trade imbalance and stop the insane plan to redistribute the wealth around the world by destroying the us economy with trillion dollar year trade imbalances this angers liberals who think that the usa has had an unfair advantage in international trade and we should just screw our own citizens and give the jobs to the rest of the world the historical premise of capitalism is that government intervention can only limit options and increase the cost of any endeavor trump wants secure america and to build wall to keep out drugs and criminals and outlaw the anarchists dream of sanctuary cities that harbor rapists murders and other criminals some liberals think this is cruel and apparently lack the intelligence to discern between criminals and legal immigrants and do not have the ability to discern between judeo christian religions that promote tolerance and liberty and the islamic religions which are primarily based on forced oligarchy controlled actions with zero liberty and zero personal rights for all women most liberal women are extremely prejudiced against anyone including trump who respond positively or negatively solely based on the content of the conversation and not based on race religion or ethnicity diamond silk are perhaps the most intelligent and observant journalists to highlight this quality about trump	0
the problem with an established elite culture is that after prolonged and repeated lying the members actually start believing their own lies refuse to have my opinion altered as the historical significance of having partial black man as president of this great country yes there were many injustices by previous cultural thinking and attitudes but we overcame those as nation and we need to celebrate that not whine about the past there is not single person living who took part in any of those injustices so why is the dnc fixated on year old issues if they want to remain stuck on stupid and keep deflecting legitimate concern about corruption and international manipulation of our countries economy and social issues by calling every question racist then the dnc is going to loose in november once we get this christophobic racist out of the white house everything will look better in this country this sick idea of dumping non english speaking anti americans into small white communities across the country is no accident it is social engineering joke being played on white america for spite of some perceived historical injustice and is being done with the intelligence of yr old brat mrs clintin is just an old incompetent low intelligent hack but what disappointment this president has been using his passive aggressive attitude to disregard all constitutional standards and all real changes by working with the congress he has used his exec action orders to illegally attempt to dictate law in this country the majority of these things were nothing more then the whims of an impatient child as most of them will all be struck down or reversed and will have no lasting affect other then to provide legacy that he has accomplished nothing but initiate frustration for millions of citizens obamo had no goals accomplished nothing of lasting significance and merely just annoyed everyone with his opinionated bullocks once we have someone in the office that actually cares about the future of all americans this country will rock	0
so exactly why are why some women are voting for mrs bill clintin there are so many people with such little confidence in themselves they refuse to acknowledge that they are being scammed screwed and made fun of anyone voting for mrs bill clintin is the same as the battered housewife who keeps justifying her husband beating the crap out of her because of abstract issues in addition to refusing to acknowledge their lack of tolerance for anyone that speaks an opposing view of the kool-aid drinking liberals anyone who actually thinks that cnn is not biased and lies on daily basis about trump and refuses to tell the truth about the clintin corruption is delusional or ignorant of all other news sources have had many discussions with people who continue to vote democrat and have summarized their actual comments below hillry has vagina and she likes to kill babies with their own unique dna and sell the body parts she insists on tax dollar support for planned parenthood which was founded for the sole purpose of reducing african american populations hillry reminds them of their christophobic and sick old grandmother as she attempts to proceed with the islamification of america and spent over months in hiding with no live press exposure in similar fashion to dictators who are dying and send out look alike stunt men for photo ops hillry put up with bill for all those years just so she could be doing this new gig so she deserves it she has never once defended bill disgusting and criminal acts throughout this entire campaign in fact she basically admitted they all happened and just wants to accuse everyone else of doing the same thing even if it requires paying people to make up lies which have been debunked hillry figured out how to sell this countries resources like uranium to make nukes and access to us markets and only acquired several hundred million dollars in the process so that just smart business person destroying all the emails and other evidence referencing these pay to play deals after congressional subpoena was issued to see them was just smart politics trump has said some mean things to people that have attacked him during the last years of his life running billion dollar business and as reality show actor and beauty pageant sponsor yes trump commented on what the judges would consider in the pagent the media even put out commercial and cataloged all they could find which was about people over years big deal have had more insulting things said to me in one week at construction site and his harsh words can compare with hillry support of sharia law countries with their fgm of teen age girls by the way some of the people he fired on the apprentice now work for him as executives including african americans and women believe we need president with this specific personality to deal with the elite dc politicians who have been raping this country for their own benefit trump might be blunt at times but actually has personality and the self confidence to not apologize for things he said that are true but uncomfortable and not pc like the teachings and the ideology of islam hates western culture and hates america or vets that use their pow status as crutch for their entire career as politician instead of actually doing something for his constituents or lying reporter pretending he has loss of memory documenting mooslim celebrations in nj trump will actually use the natural resources of this country that god gave us to get us out of debt and create level playing field with the international manufacturing market to give decent salaries to american workers this infuriates globalists who want us to become enslaved to the rest of the world by driving the national debt beyond sustainability as sovereign nation concerning energy the only problem with coal is that it is cheap and no one in the middle east has any which drives the un and the eu crazy and since after hundreds of years of use there is to of all known coal reserves still existing in the ground it is without doubt the most sustainable energy resource on the earth and needs to protected as an energy source by law against anti science globalists and even if we completely stop using all carbon based energy scientists not getting government paycheck have confirmed there would be no difference in any global climatic conditions trump will provide common sense approaches to issues of health care job creation tax reduction trade imbalance and stop the insane plan to redistribute the wealth around the world by destroying the us economy with trillion dollar year trade imbalances this angers liberals who think that the usa has had an unfair advantage in international trade and we should just screw our own citizens and give the jobs to the rest of the world progressives scheming for power always ignore the historical premise that with capitalism government intervention can only limit options and increase the cost of any endeavor trump wants secure america and to build wall to keep out drugs and criminals and outlaw the anarchists dream of sanctuary cities that harbor rapists murders and other criminals some liberals think this is cruel and apparently lack the intelligence to discern between criminals and legal immigrants and do not have the ability to discern between judeo christian religions that promote tolerance and liberty and the islamic religions which are primarily based on forced oligarchy controlled actions with zero liberty and zero personal rights for all women woman supporting the islamification of america clintin is like jewish person celebrating the accomplishments of the nazi for the record islam is not race it is an ideology to control the world that has followers who treat it like religion every person who has known trump on personal level for decades attest that trump has never acted improperly with women loves his family loves this country and will always do what is honest and proper for the citizens in this country also want president who will be awake and respond immediately within minutes to nuke attack exactly the way he responds to tweeter lies most liberal women hate trump based on their spousal envy and are extremely prejudiced against anyone including trump who respond positively or negatively solely based on the content of the conversation and not based on race religion or ethnicity actually admire trump for being able to overcome the stress of of being divorced and his ability to end up with trophy wife that is normal person of poor origins not from the aristocrat elite diamond silk are perhaps the most intelligent and observant journalists to highlight this quality about trump but most liberals are too racist to acknowledge that yes if you are voting for mrs bill clintin you are racist bigot and play xylophone	0

if you have to ask that question you are not looking for serious answer it was an opportunity to sit down face to face with someone who openly challenged him and they both walked away shaking hands this rarely happens in todays world any more this was more constructive relationship building then anything obamo or clintin has done in the last years	0
of course the accusations are absurd the questions is whether there are enough normal working people left in this country that gives crap because the clintin supporters are either living off of the teetof government or are international currency manipulators and those two groups would elect satan himself as long as the money keeps flowing	0
would like to see political add with the protest group from haiti claiming their clintin foundation charity is total fraud	0
bullocks mrs clintin is reprobate and without total and complete rigged primary she wouldn even be candidate if the dnc was really worried about the mother earth and carbon footprints they would have just canceled all of the primaries and saved all that jet fuel for bernie and all the reporters they both could have just played game of chess and called it over and the result would have been the same	0
in clintin said they ve been exposed as the trash they are bill clinton say year affair with gennifer flowers is lie bill clinton admits under oath his affair with gennifer flowers was actually true oops	0
there are so many people with such little confidence in themselves they refuse to acknowledge that they are being scammed screwed and made fun of anyone voting for mrs bill clintin is the same as the battered housewife who keeps justifying her husband beating the crap out of her because of abstract issues have had many discussions with people who continue to vote democrat and have summarized their actual comments below hillry has vagina and she likes to kill babies and sell the body parts hillry reminds them of their christophobic and sick old grandmother hillry put up with bill for all those years just so she could be doing this so she deserves it hillry figured out how to sell this countries resources like uranium to make nukes and access to us markets and only acquired several hundred million dollars in the process so that just smart business person destroying all the emails and other evidence referencing these deals was just smart politics trump has said some mean things to people that have attacked him during the last years of his life running billion dollar business and as reality show actor the media even put out commercial and cataloged all they could find which was about people over years big deal have had more insulting things said to me in one week at construction site and his harsh words can compare with hillry support of sharia law countries with their fgm of teen age girls by the way some of the people he fired on the apprentice now work for him as executives including african americans and women believe we need president with this specific personality to deal with the elite dc politicians who have been raping this country for their own benefit trump actually has personality and the self confidence to not apologize for things he said that are true but uncomfortable and not pc like the teachings and the ideology of islam hates western culture and hates america or vets that use their pow status as crutch for their entire career as politician instead of actually doing something for his constituents or lying reporter pretending he has loss of memory documenting mooslim celebrations in nj trump will actually use the natural resources of this country that god gave us to get us out of debt and create level playing field with the international manufacturing market to give decent salaries to american workers this infuriates globalists who want us to become enslaved to the rest of the world by driving the national debt beyond sustainability as sovereign nation concerning energy the only problem with coal is that it is cheap and no one in the middle east has any which drives the un and the eu crazy and since after hundreds of years of use there is to of all known coal reserves still existing in the ground it is without doubt the most sustainable energy resource on the earth and needs to protected as an energy source by law against anti science globalists and even we completely stop using all carbon based energy scientists not getting government paycheck have confirmed there would be no difference in any global climatic conditions trump will provide common sense approaches to issues of health care job creation tax reduction trade imbalance and stop the insane plan to redistribute the wealth around the world by destroying the us economy with trillion dollar year trade imbalances this angers liberals who think that the usa has had an unfair advantage in international trade and we should just screw our own citizens and give the jobs to the rest of the world progressives scheming for power always ignore the historical premise that with capitalism government intervention can only limit options and increase the cost of any endeavor trump wants secure america and to build wall to keep out drugs and criminals and outlaw the anarchists dream of sanctuary cities that harbor rapists murders and other criminals some liberals think this is cruel and apparently lack the intelligence to discern between criminals and legal immigrants and do not have the ability to discern between judeo christian religions that promote tolerance and liberty and the islamic religions which are primarily based on forced oligarchy controlled actions with zero liberty and zero personal rights for all women woman supporting the islamification of america clintin is like jewish person celebrating the accomplishments of the nazi most liberal women hate trump based on their spousal envy and are extremely prejudiced against anyone including trump who respond positively or negatively solely based on the content of the conversation and not based on race religion or ethnicity diamond silk are perhaps the most intelligent and observant journalists to highlight this quality about trump but most liberals are too racist to acknowledge that in summary have worked in an environment of college educated professionals for the past years and myself and all the friends know do not have the slightest inkling of racism in our personalities but obamo mrs bill clintin continues to call me racist and bigot for not blindly turning over my liberty to her corrupt pay for play government model as she and the entire elite dc political base calls me vile names if you call me racist to my face because of desire for secure borders and to keep radical islamic ideology and anti-humanity sharia law out of my country and my home please understand that will make the controversial responses from trump sound like chatter from grade school room here is news flash for the media who think they are going to manipulate the thoughts of the citizens of this country into giving up their liberty and work every day of their life to give tax dollars and lower our functional salaries to make the whole world have the same standard of living then you are all fat pigs with pig dung for brains readmylips no more bush and no more clintins and no more presidents of the world we need president of the usa trump join the entire country at midnight on jan so we can all flush our toilets at the same time to signify the end of the most abusive anti-american and disgusting administration in the history of this country and celebrate the beginning of some fresh air and positive thinking again with trump as our new president of the united states of america	0
hope the lame stream media all those elite dc politicians in both parties understand that if they are successful in getting clintin elected over trump that the reason trump has following will not go away and the consequences are going to be severe we will not ever go back to the lies and manipulation of the past years game over	0
jessica leeds phone number the same as clintin foundation number	0

hillry clintin has had taxpayer funded armed secret service guards since the and she keeps saying she wants the same total confiscation laws that were passed in australia and ended up increasing the crime rates now exactly why is guy on the street who had been convicted of attempted murder robbery drug dealing etc the system that made it necessary for the cop to shoot him must be fixed	0

gaffney and co would have done better in their goal of creating peace through strength by endorsing and joining up with donald trump instead they have crippled their credibility of being national security patriots by endorsing constitutionally ineligible for the presidency globalist cruz will expand policies placing americans in danger through expansive immigration border insecurity and deindustrializing with crippled economy caused by globalism cruz will worsen our budget by resurrecting no win military and christian destroying bush adventurism in the middle east unable to fund the required build up cruz will shatter the military on the hard rocks of reality this is the future of the us by supporting cruz clintin or sanders csp has done crippling damage to its standing by endorsing cruz standing already besmirched with association with neoconservatives csp must endorse and elect real patriot real nationalist by voting donald trump make america great again vote trump	0
really reasons why some women are voting for mrs bill clintin there are so many people with such little confidence in themselves they refuse to acknowledge that they are being scammed screwed and made fun of anyone voting for mrs bill clintin is the same as the battered housewife who keeps justifying her husband beating the crap out of her because of abstract issues in addition to refusing to acknowledge their lack of tolerance for anyone that speaks an opposing view of the kool-aid drinking liberals anyone who actually thinks that cnn is not biased and lies on daily basis about trump and refuses to tell the truth about the clintin corruption is delusional or ignorant of all other news sources have had many discussions with people who continue to vote democrat and have summarized their actual comments below hillry has vagina and she likes to kill babies with their own unique dna and sell the body parts she insists on tax dollar support for planned parenthood which was founded for the sole purpose of reducing african american populations hillry reminds them of their christophobic and sick old grandmother as she attempts to proceed with the islamification of america and spent over months in hiding with no live press exposure in similar fashion to dictators who are dying and send out look alike stunt men for photo ops hillry put up with bill for all those years just so she could be doing this new gig so she deserves it she has never once defended bill disgusting and criminal acts throughout this entire campaign in fact she basically admitted they all happened and just wants to accuse everyone else of doing the same thing even if it requires paying people to make up lies which have been debunked hillry figured out how to sell this countries resources like uranium to make nukes and access to us markets and only acquired several hundred million dollars in the process so that just smart business person destroying all the emails and other evidence referencing these deals after congressional subpoena was issued to see them was just smart politics trump has said some mean things to people that have attacked him during the last years of his life running billion dollar business and as reality show actor and beauty pageant sponsor yes trump commented on what the judges would consider in the pagent the media even put out commercial and cataloged all they could find which was about people over years big deal have had more insulting things said to me in one week at construction site and his harsh words can compare with hillry support of sharia law countries with their fgm of teen age girls by the way some of the people he fired on the apprentice now work for him as executives including african americans and women believe we need president with this specific personality to deal with the elite dc politicians who have been raping this country for their own benefit trump actually has personality and the self confidence to not apologize for things he said that are true but uncomfortable and not pc like the teachings and the ideology of islam hates western culture and hates america or vets that use their pow status as crutch for their entire career as politician instead of actually doing something for his constituents or lying reporter pretending he has loss of memory documenting mooslim celebrations in nj trump will actually use the natural resources of this country that god gave us to get us out of debt and create level playing field with the international manufacturing market to give decent salaries to american workers this infuriates globalists who want us to become enslaved to the rest of the world by driving the national debt beyond sustainability as sovereign nation concerning energy the only problem with coal is that it is cheap and no one in the middle east has any which drives the un and the eu crazy and since after hundreds of years of use there is to of all known coal reserves still existing in the ground it is without doubt the most sustainable energy resource on the earth and needs to protected as an energy source by law against anti science globalists and even if we completely stop using all carbon based energy scientists not getting government paycheck have confirmed there would be no difference in any global climatic conditions trump will provide common sense approaches to issues of health care job creation tax reduction trade imbalance and stop the insane plan to redistribute the wealth around the world by destroying the us economy with trillion dollar year trade imbalances this angers liberals who think that the usa has had an unfair advantage in international trade and we should just screw our own citizens and give the jobs to the rest of the world progressives scheming for power always ignore the historical premise that with capitalism government intervention can only limit options and increase the cost of any endeavor trump wants secure america and to build wall to keep out drugs and criminals and outlaw the anarchists dream of sanctuary cities that harbor rapists murders and other criminals some liberals think this is cruel and apparently lack the intelligence to discern between criminals and legal immigrants and do not have the ability to discern between judeo christian religions that promote tolerance and liberty and the islamic religions which are primarily based on forced oligarchy controlled actions with zero liberty and zero personal rights for all women woman supporting the islamification of america clintin is like jewish person celebrating the accomplishments of the nazi for the record islam is not race it is an ideology to control the world that has followers who treat it like religion every person who has known trump on personal level for decades attest that trump has never acted improperly with women loves his family loves this country and will always do what is honest and proper for the citizens in this country most liberal women hate trump based on their spousal envy and are extremely prejudiced against anyone including trump who respond positively or negatively solely based on the content of the conversation and not based on race religion or ethnicity diamond silk are perhaps the most intelligent and observant journalists to highlight this quality about trump but most liberals are too racist to acknowledge that yes if you are voting for mrs bill clintin you are racist bigot and play xylophone in summary have worked in an environment of college educated professionals for the past years and myself and all the friends know do not have the slightest inkling of racism in our personalities but obamo mrs bill clintin continues to call me racist and bigot for not blindly turning over my liberty to her corrupt pay for play government model as she and the entire elite dc political base calls me vile names if you call me racist to my face because of desire for secure borders and to keep radical islamic ideology and anti-humanity sharia law out of my country and my home please understand that will make the controversial responses from trump sound like chatter from grade school room here is news flash for the media who think they are going to manipulate the thoughts of the citizens of this country into giving up their liberty and work every day of their life to give tax dollars and lower our functional salaries to make the whole world have the same standard of living then you are all fat pigs with pig dung for brains readmylips no more bush and no more clintins and no more presidents of the world we need president of the usa trump join the entire country at midnight on jan so we can all flush our toilets at the same time to signify the end of the most abusive anti-american and disgusting administration in the history of this country and celebrate the beginning of some fresh air and positive thinking again with trump as our new president of the united states of america	0
right now this review would most certainly be split if clintin is in office it will be against the nd amendment and then there will be flood of similar restrictive laws all over the country to neuter the nd amendment it will happen	0
wow this confirms all of the rhetoric and all of the discussions and all of the accusations that these good ole boys made up of elite dc politicians in both parties which include mrs bill clintin don give dam about the american people and apparently never did this is great news as it will release all the democrats who actually have brain and care about their families future to vote for trump this enforces the concept of collaboration between the parties against america for the accolades of joining the world to use us as their slaves to re-distribute the wealth around the world trump will go down in history as the guy who blew the lid off of this long running silent conspiracy against everything we do this should boost trump another in the poling	0
did not know that ralph nader was till alive recall his statement back in the that his primary goal in life was to just screw up the system as much as he could what worthless negative person in this case he can screw up the clintin campaign all he wants to	0
regardless what her condition is she is the dem puppet now and will continue to be until the international globalist financial donors say off with her head love the recent clip where she goes into hysterical laughter while looking at the ceiling and no one around her knows what she is laughing about including the secret service guys who actually look scared to many meds mental breakdown who knows do recall when my mother-in-law started to fall down all the time she had to go from limited care to full time care perhaps mrs clintin thinks she will just hide out in the white house for years while bill turns the place back into frat party house again and will probably max out his pharmacy using the blue pill oh about running the country what diff does it make arf arf arf	0
it is pretty simple being dem or rep makes no difference any more if you are supporter of graft corruption wasting tax dollars squandering our future then you are for mrs clintin and continued destruction or our ability to be sovereign nation and continue to pretend that you don like trump because of his personality yea the pc correct stuff is the current method to intimidate everyone to abandon their heritage and their culture in as all you have to do is start calling someone racist bigot bla bla bla guess what thanks to trump it don work anymore liberal progressive loud mouths are going to be forced to actually debate issues well in my mind by many issues to review trump is actually more of social conservative then any president we have had in modern history he openly declares not using booze or drugs and deep concern for the security and standard of living for the citizens of this country he does not appear to have any animosity toward any group about anything beyond the security of our country and our future this includes protecting all existing legal immigrants with protection from illegals creating low wages and higher crime rates some documentaries state that over of all current violent crime is from illegal aliens by many endorsements of people who have known him for decades including ex-wives he is family man who instilled the old ethic of hard work and honesty to all of his children by him admitting that he was not faithful to his ex-wives he is on the same level as bill clinton when he admitted he smoked pot we have had presidents and other dc politicians who have been involved in sexual relationships with celebrities interns secretaries and others while in office some of these relationships ended up with the death of the other person involved including incidents that would have resulted in grand jury investigation and arrests if it involved normal citizen many if not most of the dc politicians are corrupt in their activities to manipulate laws and the spending of tax payer money for unnecessary things from improper people simply because it makes it easier to obtain campaign finances so in essence the tax payers pay twice for nothing received all of these politicians are now becoming so self righteous about trump and his trophy wife and are irritated that they have spent their whole career hiding their affairs and keeping up appearances the female politicians take it to new level of hypocritical comments when their primary issue is simply spousal envy so here is trump as honest as the day is long with desire to help this country out of debt out of decade long recession and to gain back some global respect we completely lost with the current president recent sec of state duo this country has to change the current strategy of being charity to the rest of the world and start acting	0
this is nuts first obamo sec clintin create this civil war and then they perpetuate it we need to stop this nonsense and in fact we need to go over there and repo all of our military equipment for the entire middle east let them all kill each other with russian made equipment instead of ours as side line we can leave scorched earth behind as we recover our hardware	0
hope putin bombs the clintin library	0
am hoping that trump uses his middle finger to rub his face three times to send message every time mrs bill clintin speaks	0

since everyone knows that mrs bill clintin has permanent brain damage as shown by her cross eyed and lower body parralysis events coupled with the coughing fits from being over medicated and will most like become totally incapacitated within the next year so many dems were hoping they could take some comfort in having vp with minimum level of intelligence and political abilities with kain- not so much	0

after years of obamo clintin kerry the entire globe is such mess that nothing surprises me we would have been better off with no sec of state for years now it looks like the most logical solution is to re-distribute the nukes we have stored in turkey for decades and move them to ukraine south korea philippines malaysia and okinawa japan if we have any left after that perhaps we can put few in arizona	0

why some women are voting for the lickspittle and catamite mrs bill clintin there are so many people with such little confidence in themselves they refuse to acknowledge that they are being scammed screwed and made fun of anyone voting for mrs bill clintin is the same as the battered housewife who keeps justifying her husband beating the crap out of her because of abstract issues in addition to refusing to acknowledge their lack of tolerance for anyone that speaks an opposing view of the kool-aid drinking liberals anyone who actually thinks that cnn is not biased and lies on daily basis about trump and refuses to tell the truth about the clintin corruption is delusional or ignorant of all other news sources have had many discussions with people who continue to vote democrat and have summarized their actual comments below hillry has vagina and she likes to kill babies with their own unique dna and sell the body parts she insists on tax dollar support for planned parenthood which was founded for the sole purpose of reducing african american populations hillry reminds them of their christophobic and sick old grandmother as she attempts to proceed with the islamification of america and spent over months in hiding with no live press exposure in similar fashion to dictators who are dying and send out look alike stunt men for photo ops hillry put up with bill for all those years just so she could be doing this new gig so she deserves it she has never once defended bill disgusting and criminal acts throughout this entire campaign in fact she basically admitted they all happened and just wants to accuse everyone else of doing the same thing even if it requires paying people to make up lies which have been debunked hillry figured out how to sell this countries resources like uranium to make nukes and access to us markets and only acquired several hundred million dollars in the process so that just smart business person destroying all the emails and other evidence referencing these pay to play deals after congressional subpoena was issued to see them was just smart politics trump has said some mean things to people that have attacked him during the last years of his life running billion dollar business and as reality show actor and beauty pageant sponsor yes trump commented on what the judges would consider in the pagent the media even put out commercial and cataloged all they could find which was about people over years big deal have had more insulting things said to me in one week at construction site and his harsh words can compare with hillry support of sharia law countries with their fgm of teen age girls by the way some of the people he fired on the apprentice now work for him as executives including african americans and women believe we need president with this specific personality to deal with the elite dc politicians who have been raping this country for their own benefit trump might be blunt at times but actually has personality and the self confidence to not apologize for things he said that are true but uncomfortable and not pc like the teachings and the ideology of islam hates western culture and hates america or vets that use their pow status as crutch for their entire career as politician instead of actually doing something for his constituents or lying reporter pretending he has loss of memory documenting mooslim celebrations in nj trump will actually use the natural resources of this country that god gave us to get us out of debt and create level playing field with the international manufacturing market to give decent salaries to american workers this infuriates globalists who want us to become enslaved to the rest of the world by driving the national debt beyond sustainability as sovereign nation concerning energy the only problem with coal is that it is cheap and no one in the middle east has any which drives the un and the eu crazy and since after hundreds of years of use there is to of all known coal reserves still existing in the ground it is without doubt the most sustainable energy resource on the earth and needs to protected as an energy source by law against anti science globalists and even if we completely stop using all carbon based energy scientists not getting government paycheck have confirmed there would be no difference in any global climatic conditions trump will provide common sense approaches to issues of health care job creation tax reduction trade imbalance and stop the insane plan to redistribute the wealth around the world by destroying the us economy with trillion dollar year trade imbalances this angers liberals who think that the usa has had an unfair advantage in international trade and we should just screw our own citizens and give the

after spending several years in china can speculate as to the real issue here she apparently took some ones business customer away who had connections in the government and they fabricated charges against her to pretend that china has any intellectual property that they haven stole from someone else is absurd this is all common in chinese business circles they pull some strings and web sites disappear email addresses are blocked and their texts are delayed for weeks at time and their phone conversation are listened too some of this stuff happened to me the communist chinese government is so corrupt it makes putin look like mother teresa and oh yea the obamo clintin kerry state dept doesn give flying fudgcycle about her or any american for that matter	0
this stuff is just the beginning mrs clintin created so much chaos the last time she was in the white house it seemed like there was new incident every week involving graft corruption intimidation and hate crimes against anyone like of got in her way when bill clinton was president he allowed hillary to assume authority over an attempt to health care reform even after threats and intimidation she couldn get vote in democrat controlled us congress this fiasco cost the american taxpayers about million for studies promotion and other efforts then president clinton gave hillary authority over selecting female attorney general her first two selections were zoe baird and kimba wood both were forced to withdraw their names from consideration next she chose janet reno husband bill described her selection as my worst mistake some may not remember that reno made the decision to gas david koresh and the branch davidian religious sect in waco texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children burned alive the original search warrant for waco was to collect taxes for gun that was purchased legally after years of legal proceedings it was determined that were no laws broken there were many other examples of harassing groups of people hillry just didn like husband bill allowed hillary to make recommendations for the head of the civil rights commission lani guanier was her selection when little probing led to the discovery of ms guanier radical views her name had to be withdrawn from consideration apparently slow learner husband bill allowed hillary to make some more recommendations she chose former law partners web hubbel for the justice department vince foster for the white house staff and william kennedy for the treasury departmenther selections went well hubbel went to prison foster presumably committed suicide and kennedy was forced to resign many younger voters will have no knowledge of travelgate hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to clinton friend harry thompson and the white house travel office refused to comply she managed to have them reported to the fbi and had them fired this ruined their reputations cost them their jobs and caused thirty-six month investigation only one employee billy dale was charged with crime and that of the enormous crime of mixing personal and white house funds jury acquitted him of any crime in less than two hours apparently still not convinced of her ineptness hillary was allowed to recommend close clinton friend craig livingstone for the position of director of white house security when livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about fbi files of clinton enemies filegate and the widespread use of drugs by white house staff suddenly hillary and the president denied even knowing livingstone and of course denied any knowledge of drug use in the white house following this debacle the fbi closed its white house liaison office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents next when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by bill clinton hillary was put in charge of the bimbo eruption and scandal defense some of her more notable decisions in the debacle were she urged her husband not to settle the paula jones lawsuit after the starr investigation they settled with ms jones she refused to release the whitewater documents which led to the appointment of ken starr as special prosecutor after million dollars of taxpayer money was spent starr investigation led to monica lewinsky which led to bill lying about and later admitting his affairs hillary devious game plan resulted in bill losing his license to practice law for lying under oath to grand jury and then his subsequent impeachment by the house of representatives hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the starr investigation by repeating do not recall have no recollection and don know total of times while under oath after leaving the white house hillary was forced to return an estimated in white house furniture china and artwork that she had stolen what swell person well are you ready for another four or eight years of this now we are exposed to the unsecure keeping and attempted destruction of beyond top secret emails while hillary was us secretary of state and the pay to play schemes of the clinton foundation where the foundation took money from foreign governments and then bill wrote checks of to to himself for speaking to charity events what shoe will fall next but to her loyal fans who are apparently brain dead and are only concerned with unfettered rights to kill their own children what difference does it make	0

why some women are voting for the lickspittle and catamite mrs bill clintin there are so many people with such little confidence in themselves they refuse to acknowledge that they are being scammed screwed and made fun of anyone voting for mrs bill clintin is the same as the battered housewife who keeps justifying her husband beating the crap out of her because of abstract issues in addition to refusing to acknowledge their lack of tolerance for anyone that speaks an opposing view of the kool-aid drinking liberals anyone who actually thinks that cnn is not biased and lies on daily basis about trump and refuses to tell the truth about the clintin corruption is delusional or ignorant of all other news sources have had many discussions with people who continue to vote democrat and have summarized their actual comments below hillry has vagina and she likes to kill babies with their own unique dna and sell the body parts she insists on tax dollar support for planned parenthood which was founded for the sole purpose of reducing african american populations hillry reminds them of their christophobic and sick old grandmother as she attempts to proceed with the islamification of america and spent over months in hiding with no live press exposure in similar fashion to dictators who are dying and send out look alike stunt men for photo ops hillry put up with bill for all those years just so she could be doing this new gig so she deserves it she has never once defended bill disgusting and criminal acts throughout this entire campaign in fact she basically admitted they all happened and just wants to accuse everyone else of doing the same thing even if it requires paying people to make up lies which have been debunked hillry figured out how to sell this countries resources like uranium to make nukes and access to us markets and only acquired several hundred million dollars in the process so that just smart business person destroying all the emails and other evidence referencing these pay to play deals after congressional subpoena was issued to see them was just smart politics trump has said some mean things to people that have attacked him during the last years of his life running billion dollar business and as reality show actor and beauty pageant sponsor yes trump commented on what the judges would consider in the pagent the media even put out commercial and cataloged all they could find which was about people over years big deal have had more insulting things said to me in one week at construction site and his harsh words can compare with hillry support of sharia law countries with their fgm of teen age girls by the way some of the people he fired on the apprentice now work for him as executives including african americans and women believe we need president with this specific personality to deal with the elite dc politicians who have been raping this country for their own benefit trump might be blunt at times but actually has personality and the self confidence to not apologize for things he said that are true but uncomfortable and not pc like the teachings and the ideology of islam hates western culture and hates america or vets that use their pow status as crutch for their entire career as politician instead of actually doing something for his constituents or lying reporter pretending he has loss of memory documenting mooslim celebrations in nj trump will actually use the natural resources of this country that god gave us to get us out of debt and create level playing field with the international manufacturing market to give decent salaries to american workers this infuriates globalists who want us to become enslaved to the rest of the world by driving the national debt beyond sustainability as sovereign nation concerning energy the only problem with coal is that it is cheap and no one in the middle east has any which drives the un and the eu crazy and since after hundreds of years of use there is to of all known coal reserves still existing in the ground it is without doubt the most sustainable energy resource on the earth and needs to protected as an energy source by law against anti science globalists and even if we completely stop using all carbon based energy scientists not getting government paycheck have confirmed there would be no difference in any global climatic conditions trump will provide common sense approaches to issues of health care job creation tax reduction trade imbalance and stop the insane plan to redistribute the wealth around the world by destroying the us economy with trillion dollar year trade imbalances this angers liberals who think that the usa has had an unfair advantage in international trade and we should just screw our own citizens and give the jobs to the rest of the world progressives scheming for power always ignore the historical premise that with capitalism government intervention can only limit options and increase the cost of any endeavor trump wants secure america and to build wall to keep out drugs and criminals and outlaw the anarchists dream of sanctuary cities that harbor rapists murders and other criminals some liberals think this is cruel and apparently lack the intelligence to discern between criminals and legal immigrants and do not have the ability to discern between judeo christian religions that promote tolerance and liberty and the islamic religions which are primarily based on forced oligarchy controlled actions with zero liberty and zero personal rights for all women woman supporting the islamification of america clintin is like jewish person celebrating the accomplishments of the nazi for the record islam is not race it is an ideology to control the world that has followers who treat it like religion every person who has known trump on personal level for decades attest that trump has never acted improperly with women loves his family loves this country and will always do what is honest and proper for the citizens in this country also want president who will be awake and respond immediately within minutes to nuke attack exactly the way he responds to tweeter lies some liberal women hate trump based on their spousal envy and are extremely prejudiced against anyone including trump who respond positively or negatively solely based on the content of the conversation and not based on race religion or ethnicity actually admire trump for being able to overcome the stress of of being divorced and his ability to end up with trophy wife that is normal person of poor origins not from the aristocrat elite diamond silk are perhaps the most intelligent and observant journalists to highlight this quality about trump but most liberals are too racist to acknowledge that yes if you are voting for mrs bill clintin you are racist bigot and play xylophone	0

ok so my latest summary mrs clintin always making excuses for not accomplishing any goals asking for rewards for just trying hard really running for president totally based on who her husband is spent year flying around the world with no purpose resulting in the creation of isis and the largest refugee migration since wwii trump when he screws up he says screwed up and moves on concentrates on achieving goals and refuses any accolades unless he actually accomplished goal he is the only candidate in that has any credibility to accomplish any of the goals put forth and in fact is the only candidate that presented the issues americans care about instead of the years old canned bs from the dc politicians bernie has trouble with math not enough gdp to provide funding for all of his wish list freebie jewish guy who bashes jews simply not logical better feminist then mrs clintin cruz bush extended family member who has stolen all of trumps talking points and then lies about trumps positions on those points has trouble finding any christian leader to endorse him carly outsourcing queen of the decade destroyed more jobs and wasted more money then any other candidate case itchy resented the fact that his father was mailman he has never gotten over it	0

like any sports game or business deal the one who wins is the one who has the best message or best status at the end not the beginning if you peak early all that does is create adrenaline and frantic activities in the opposition and in this case that would be soros and murdick dumping millions more into the anarchy groups of hate which could result in burning cities down and murder at the end of the day anyone with conscience will not be able to vote for mrs clintin and her cash machine and if they care about their family and their future at all they will vote trump	0
as an aside heard that mrs clintin has had secret service protection since which is on ereason she has no problem with complete gun confiscation program	0
wow you mean the stupid peasants in this country just might be able to discern between the entire mulsoom populations of the world and terrorists or the entire country of mexico and illegal aliens made up of drug lords murderers and rapists or perhaps that there might have been at least one criticism of this administration based on the subject matter and not the color of his skin as he responds to every question for the last years the problem with an established elite culture is that after prolonged and repeated lying the members actually start believing their own lies refuse to have my opinion altered as the historical significance of having partial black man as president of this great country yes there were many injustices by previous cultural thinking and attitudes but we overcame those as nation and we need to celebrate that not whine about the past there is not single person living who took part in any of those injustices so why is the dnc fixated on year old issues if they want to remain stuck on stupid and keep deflecting legitimate concern about corruption and international manipulation of our countries economy and social issues by calling every question racist then the dnc is going to loose in november once we get this christophobic racist out of the white house everything will look better in this country this sick idea of dumping non english speaking anti americans into small white communities across the country is no accident it is social engineering joke being played on white america for spite of some perceived historical injustice and is being done with the intelligence of yr old brat mrs clintin is just an old incompetent low intelligent hack but what disappointment this president has been using his passive aggressive attitude to disregard all constitutional standards and all real changes by working with the congress he has used his exec action orders to illegally attempt to dictate law in this country the majority of these things were nothing more then the whims of an impatient child as most of them will all be struck down or reversed and will have no lasting affect other then to provide legacy that he has accomplished nothing but initiate frustration for millions of citizens obamo had no goals accomplished nothing of lasting significance and merely just annoyed everyone with his opinionated bullocks once we have someone in the office that actually cares about the future of all americans this country will rock	0

canacruz doesn stand much of shot even without the canadian thing hanging over his head cubio has better shot but he too has an eligibility issue to deal with at least he was actually born in the usa although he is was an anchor baby imagine if we encouraged letting illegal immigrants come here simply to have baby so they could be considered american and live off of that system for yeas as result that was the rubio couple non us citizens illegal some years ago that isn right	1
canacruz is canadian in fact he isn true natural born citizen of any country really think about it mommy was american daddy was cuban rafael eduardo canacruz born in canada but neither of his folks were canucks so that makes him nbc of nowhere cubio mom and pops came here illegally and dropped cubio on to us soil but they weren us citizens what the hell is going on around here cubio the puppet canacruz for prime minister	1
me thinkest you should instead vote for lyin booger-eater ted canacruz or maybe that little kid who was standing next to trump on stage last night	1
hillary will most likely make america hated again cubio will be sued soon for eligibility canacruz will be sued soon for eligibility trump will continue to make common sense and show his experienced executive leadership as he continues to trumptrounce his critics like fox news levin limbaugh telemundo the mexican fox etc he will be endorsed today and monday by more and more insiders who are finally coming out of the closet and believing that he can and will indeed make america great again	1
appears that it is time for cubio to have suit brought against him for his eligibility issue america needs to know that cubio is the son of parents that were not us citizens when he was born and were what is considered here illegally both cubio and canacruz have the issue to deal with either now or soon it isn matter of if it will happen it is matter of when it will happen unless each of them drops out cubio couldn even get reelected in florida right now to us senate	1
replicrat and demicans they ve been the same damn party for years this year they are so desperate and scared after what happened with brexit they re all coming out of the globalist corporatist closet this sh is actually so whacked it like they re all members of secret society like the satanic freaks in rosemary baby	1
ok then lets call trump replicrat or demican does it matter as long as he gets something done	1
the gop won check and trump has promised the moon and stars be prepared to be disappointed when you keep voting gop and nothing changes try voting for other than the replicrat party	1
what crock of sh_t tell the lazy ass americans to get to work million americans not working your replicrat policies caused all this never take responsibilities but just shove it on to future generations because your bunch of chickensht politicians	1
and the gope wonder why we re for trump they are absolutely clueless go trump destroy this feckless replicrat party we want support our citizen selected candidate	1
castellanos is drunk trump must go further now by telling boehner and mcconnell to man-up and stop obama time to call them out by name we know they are incompetent and liberal republicans but they must man-up and work this will push trump pass within week it would be as if the election was today ball these nitwits in congress what what moreover there good chance to primaried boehner in ohio and other liberal republicans candidates for trump run against the lazy and obamaite republicans so-called tea party candidates just don work out most of the time to primaried these bush republicans most become rino the same day elected hence rubio rand paul ayotte robinson and so on	0
turned out he did not have enough democrat votes to save his obamaite rear but still that ohio district enjoyed reelecting him over and over as much as the entire state pride their homosexual kasick	0
well there you have it rubio is part of the problem and has been all along closet obamaite no wonder him and mccain get along so well they share the same donors and mindset goodbye rubio trump will take you out go trump	0
yesterday there was former state dept employee and committed obamaite speaking in wide-eyed terms about the simple and wise necessity of launching another air campaign against isis in libya because it worked so well the first time it was indicative of the politically-conditioned fantasy-world in which the team obama personnel live the middle east has literally gone to hell during the obama years and these people are content like it no big deal	0
this was case of an obamaite deciding that the potus approves of muslim hatred obama only speaks when blacks are killed by whites he is the lousiest president but worse heis lousy person because he enjoys hatred and promotes it every chance he gets sadly there are no republicans who attack him about this and no white groups that disregard his press and tell the real story obama is muslim in his heart his relation to rev wright was because the rev attacked white people which humored obama	0
jihadi is just another word for obamaite they all work together against america and western civilization	0
you trump guys are becoming insane you re in danger of becoming cult of some kind yeah fox sucks levin sucks beck sucks national review sucks christians suck cruz sucks etc it as if you are purposely pushing yourselves into smaller and smaller corner where only the donald speaks the truth geez can you say obamaite	0
just another mentally ill obamaite	0
okay now if this continues in favor of cruz start preparing for hillary rodham clinton in the pink house unless trump can save the day and run independent turns out the two cuban relentless attacks beck cult following republicans and republican media do control lot voters cruz was not supposed to win over two states rip america still stands only trump can defeat any obamaite candidate and rodham got that and the women vote without trump it liberal liberal liberal till the end of the us of and it coming soon	0
have you been able to discern any difference between trumpster and an obamaite judging from these comments they seem to be if not the same people at least the same mentality	0
hahaha you re too lazy to do your own homework and the lazy ass you must be an obamaite on full ride at some community college working on that general studies associate degree bring triple digit iq to the party honey	0
as thought crickets you don have anybody in fact your obamaite loser commie	0
foreigners not here do not get constitutional protection obamaite further he can change the term muslim to iran pakistan etc then its legal	0
oh my little obamaite pretty sure one of the characteristics of dictator is to ignore laws like ignoring the laws pertaining to immigration ignoring and trying to interfer with freedom of religion like making churches pay for abortions and other things that are agaist their beliefs threatening ice agents to stop doing their job ignoring cities that break federal laws because their lawbreaking is helping his overall goals of overwhelming the american system of government this is not some crazy tbought of mine it is well accepted plan of the left designed by clower and piven who barry is not only aware of but probably taught his attempt to interfere with the right to bear arms by buying up so much ammo until the last six months or so of the most popular calibers ammo was unavailable he also used drones to kill american citizens who had no trail no finding of right or wrong in some cases these were not even ifin war zones even though there is method of having trial when the defendent isn available there are many other examples but the main problem is you dont understand what dictator is castro is dictator even though for the most part he doesn kill or imprision as many people as he used to and barry buddy in venezuela who sure barry thought died to young both he and castro are kindred spirits with our boy barry trust me the only reason barry hasnt instigated re education camps is obama doesnt believe the military would follow orders to control american citizens thats why he choose to arm government union members who are far more likely to follow his orders why else would groups like the usda the post office epa blm the department of energy and other agency need automatic weapons and the equivalent of swat teams remember we saw this in texas the blm doesn need swat team there are actual law enforcement agency that could have handled the situation one step at time the democrats are planning dictatorship or some form of police state they think that the people are to stupid to decide whats best for them and they need the power to think for them its to bad you aren smart enough to see that dictator doesnt have to control all aspects of life he just needs to ignore the ones he wants or pretends there are laws when none exist besides dictator can be benevolent such as in monarchy	0
the voters of wisconsin must take note of what obamaite this clown is am sick of both party they are all bunch of elitist that most could never made dime without being elected welfare recipient the republican are acting like the cotton pickin dems and have since the election of george we need voter revolution to boot them all out and remind them they are representatives and not blessed by the crown to be over us if trump is duped at the convention there will be civil disobedience am not very optimistic believe there are many that want to sabotage trump at any cost and believe the number culprit is the bush family and their pure arrogance to being dismantled by trump in the campaign	0
ryan is doing the same thing that obamaite idiot speaker before him did for years that was to say something that american american values then switch to democrat submission and agendas trump stating actually heard he was going to take the other stance that he was going to pass something where he not going to allow funding and it not going to happen and all that is how ryan is going to operate just like boehner	0
the democrats are getting more money than the republicans so yes it is up for discussion sometimes you make sense please don sound like an obamaite and say it is not up for discussion	0
unrelated imho donald trump should not do the nbc townhall with matt lauer have no doubt in my mind that nbc will give hillary clinton the questions ahead of time and he will be walking into trap in regard to the upcoming presidential debates do not understand why the rnc would agree to have anderson cooper big clinton foundation donor and lester holmes racist obamaite as of the moderators these debates since do not view chris wallace as conservative it appears that the dems areally calling the shots again	0
he would need to run as third candidate even third party candidate such as an independent or other he won need to be in any primaries that would be for the democrats and republicans here wish rubio bush romney and most likely several other obamaite bush republicans and then there ted cruz running as an independent or other conservatives would not participate in the primaries because they are waiting for the general to vote for ted cruz with to without conservatives bush would be the republican choice that been proven it fix that liberal republican are nominated after pretend primary battle but ted cruz would be outside of that corrupt primaries show he been campaigning for the general and getting the message out reagan was sort of third candidate until the liberal republicans placed bush herbert in the picture to trash reagan policies and economic policies with labels such as voodoo economics and cowboy mentality that almost worked for the liberal republicans same rinos now in congress will be for example cruz lee bush romney and biden warren ballot	0
there is no right to marry gay people can marry anytime they want as long as it is someone of the opposite sex just like the rest of us same sex people do not marry are not married and never will be married fact there is no right to health care obamacare does not ensure people get health care all it does is require people purchase insurance forcing businesses to insure employees who work over hours per week while making it untenable for insurance companies to stay in the insurance business by making insurance too expensive for anyone to afford and forcing businesses to turn the population into part time employees then when the insurance companies all go out of business the obamaite government will blame them for not covering people and force single payer on the nation that is the end game of the communists in washington is that what you really want for your country	0
when the cameras were pointed at him and he had buried himself with references to islam and supported terrorists in the white house oh wait this wasn obama voluntarily going to church this was when he was politicizing the deaths of church members good try obamaite	0
nor as canadian ubtil years ago and suppose the bush running his campain is no big deal either you re just like an obamaite except oabama was actually born in the us and will ignore what you would consider minor important facts in support of your guy he stealing the right of the people to vote in co but thats no big deal either would the people of co picked him we don know because the people didnt get chance to vote but it is cruz so its no big deal if trump had did that would seriously reconsider who support but like an obamaite you cruzbot will support that snake after he bites you and pumps you full of poisin you ll still support like an obamite supports his her master obama	0
hard to be excited about felon warmonger pathological liar globalist obamaite and puppet for the elite who will do or say anything	0

nazi run amerikka to you obamaite gotta get your pc straight big brother will be watching	0
gt and as much as the sandernistas attempt to disarticulate sanders progressive domestic policies from his documented support for empire even the obamaite aphorism the perfect is the enemy of the good is unashamedly deployed it should be obvious that his campaign is an ideological prop albeit from center left position of the logic and interests of the capitalist-imperialist settler state	0

shillery and obama know that to control the american people you first have to take their guns they learned well from the islamist turks who committed genocide against christian armenians killing million of them the first action of the islamist turks was to completely disarm the christian armenians then the muslims began killing the men and forcing women and children on death marches without food	1

cruz is without doubt the most proven true conservative but he didn get the nomination even though voted for him here in texas with that said when november arrives there will only be two viable choices for president and the decision between shillery and trump is very easy one for me as would assume it would be for any one that isn an illogical liberal shillery supporter we have to start somewhere to stop the insane liberal pc nonsense that is destroying this great country and if that change starts with trump then so be it these people need to stop whining about their favorite candidate not getting the nomination and look at the real goal defeating shillery	1

didn the gop atopsy itself four years ago instead of governing and embracing facts and science it proceeded to shut down the government and continue to deny climate change and wink at birtherism and due to trump outrageousness the gop will undoubtedly forget the hideous primary season and demogoguery of cruz and rubio the two mainstream gop candidates who all the pundits said would beat hillary cruz is an anarchist who showed integrity until he voted for the guy who he said was unfit rubio was demagogue with cute face who repeatedly implied that obama was some plant sent to the oval office to tear down our democracy don get me started on chaffetz who said the p$ sy tape was bridge too far and woudn vote for trump until he did because he is about to impeach our soon to be new president who by the way was cleared again by the fbi br br go to the excellent article on demographics of the voters there is reason why the gop loses with educated voters we are tired of the ignorant rhetoric cynicism and do nothingness of mcconnell and the house freedom coaltion trump is not an anonomaly the gop has done nothing for the citizens of this nation aside from wars in well over years don think it is just that freak show trump who has you in siberia wink wink you are hodgepodge of niche voters join the st century and seriously try to govern rather than obstruct and maybe you ll be relevant again	0
donald trump does not give the impression he will work with you to turn the american economy into yesterday news quel dommage with you though doctor let you and increase federal spending as percentage of gdp to the way the do in socialist paradise so we may all work in the equivalent of one giant post office where there no longer any such thing as opportunity for advancement the people don want that after all and where we all can wear identical grey uniforms with our names on them naturally and the facial expressions typically found in such environments haven seen death represented on person face since my last time picking up mail being held for me in my local branch please stop	0
how optimistic the reality br br culturally embedded french anti-semitism is simply playing itself out all over again by acquiring useful catspaw this time passionately zealous muslims imported by the planeload supported with generous cash benefits and allowed to run amok at will there is security theater parades of dramatically sobbing french and great deal of lip service about frenchness after each grisly islamic mass-murder before everyone drifts away for coffee and gitane br br how this is actually playing out the good french can tsk over their wine and terroir cheese as the bodies of jews and other non-muslims poets writers artists chiildren people shopping for dinner begin to stack up to the joyous screams of allahu akbar it isn after all their fault that such primitive barbarity is occurring in france is it quelle dommage	0
well never understood the strange relationship that our british neighbours have with the eu they are ok with benefiting from the common market but are reluctant when it comes to talk about politics and involvment they ve never felt very comfortable with the union but never really tried to change it france germany italy all these countries try to influence manipulate control the union which makes it living ecosystem de facto uk is out of it dommage	0
stuart appear to believe there is difference between the party establishments whereas there is not both beholden to the donor class which is why trump poses threat to them if both parties not in cahoots with each other and with obama how does one explain the fact that virtually everything obama has done in the past years has the imprimatur of the establishment ryan and other overrated republicans have shown more hostility towards trump their nominee than to clinton when trump says system is rigged he is referring not only to possible voter fraud--illegals using driver licence as voter but also to the vast panoply of journos and their print colleagues who submit stories for prior approval to dnc and to their closeness to podesta countless numbers of reporters have been invited to his home for gueuleton and few have turned him down don you read the papers not aware of wikileaks revelations no one is more sexist than hrc threatened victims of her husband sexual depredations and when asked about ayaan hsiri ali somalian woman crusading against fgm and the action taken by brandeis to disinvite her due to pressure from care hrc had no comment some crusader for womens rights since your comment has received almost recommendations presume that they share your level of sophistication est quand meme dommage	0
this article along with many others here clearly demonstrates that the new york times publisher recent vow to rededicate the paper to reporting fairly and honestly is serious one br br voice of racism absolutely just as have been president reagan bush bush and all of their irredeemable deplorable bigoted supporters but why omit or downplay the islamophobe misogynist homophobe and xenophobe tendencies which they all share perhaps the clinton campaign is now in bit of disarray and can no longer be relied upon for truly full-throated-attack ghostwriting est dommage	0

am waiting for carly to become irrelevant once again and it shouldn be long now you cannot believe anything that comes from those pursed angry lips as former hp saw the destruction she wreaked internally was there before during and after her reign of incompetence she hammered that merger with compaq down everyone throats when business analysts employees and long-term shareholders were against it that decision devastated hp and destroyed her ceo career one of carly favorite phrases is crony capitalism well forcing an unwanted merger with an unprofitable company and then offshoring jobs and laying off tens of thousands of employees as result is crony capitalism at its worst thousands of jobs were off-shored to india including mine and my team cruella even forced long-time hp employees to fly to india to train their replacements it didn bother her though she was too busy with her celebrity ceo events like having her picture taken with gwen stefani over an hp-branded camera that stefani designed it all there folks on the internet for your own due diligence carly done the same thing with the altered or even fictitious planned parenthood videos hammering them in as talking point ad nauseam until her poll numbers have all but disappeared she continues to do so even after grand jury found there was substantial evidence to send the trial of those two anti-abortion activists to petite jury sat on grand jury for over year and we did not turn down one case when the assistant attorneys bring evidence before grand jury you can better believe they have their ducks in row doubt she ll ever be the ceo of another major corporation after her tenures at both lucent and hp nor will she ever be president the most she can probably hope for is to write another book about how successful she thinks she is and continue to collect speaking fees from those hypnotized by her forked tongue	0

thank you for posting this ve liked kilmeade on the morning show but had no idea he was so obnoxious and so gope ever since the first debate ve pretty much been shutting out most of the pundits on fox no longer watch beair never watched cruella deville megyn kelly watch some of reilly except when he keeps having the far left on so he can argue with them like hannity but sometimes he too brings on the worse of the worse so he can argue with them recently discovered lou dobbs on fbn and stuart varney they are both very conservative and actually argued with reilly about trump they were supporting trump so now dvr them and try to stay away from fox most of the time unless some really big story breaks it has been clear to me in the last two elections that fox is solid establishment candidates so sometimes watch them to see who not to vote for thanks again for the news about kilmeade	0

first am lifelong reagan conservative never defended liberalism all said is in the realm of politics it was very arrogant and not smart to insult many of the people you would need to get elected all he did was show his academic elitist snobbery in snarky way if want snarky ll watch cruella deville megyn kelly cruz very much reminds me of another academic snob one time senator who can get along with anyone who disagrees with him barrack hussein obama and according to insiders heidi cruz is the same as michelle think ve had enough of academic snobs we need bare knuckles fighter non-pc international business man who is an unabashedly supporter of american exceptionalism who has vowed to stop all the illegal people coming in here to take advantage of our generosity and spit on us at the same time we need someone who loves our military and our suffering vets and more importantly someone who will break up the very corrupt cabals cartels who are choking the life out of america for their own gain they are so terrified of trump the days of party loyalty are over there is no difference anymore between the rinos and the dems go trump make america great and safe again	0

politics of fear this from no less than fox news republican party internal fundraising document outlines an aggressive campaign focusing on fear of president obama and comparisons to socialism politico obtained the page document from democrat it explains gop fundraising logic as what can you sell when you do not have the white house the house or the senate the answer save the country from trending toward socialism there is also slide titled the evil empire that has caricature of president obama as the joker house speaker nancy pelosi as cruella de vil and senate majority leader harry reid as scooby doo republican chairman michael steele calls the gop document inappropriate and says he is dealing with it administratively think the rnc has american beat when it comes to political propaganda fear baiting at it best	0

well actually reilly and several others reported that there was memo from somewhere for kelly and beair to take trump out in the first debate ignored it until the debate opened and in the first seconds megyn cruella deville was all over trump with her snarkey sneering crapola quickly followed by beair demands for trump to sign loyalty pledge never watched megyn much now she not allowed on my tv at all only tune into beair if there is national issue that is urgent like the san bernardino killings ve recently discovered lou dobbs and stuart varney on fbn good shows predominately conservative very refreshing and frank luntz started out trying to take out trump but his focus groups overwhelmed him with trump support and he finally had to become fan of trump	0

ailes is just figurehead at foxe for the past couple of years when rupurt murdoch retired he left the running of foxe to his two uber-left sons who then elevated cruella deville kelly from the mid-day slot to the prime time night slot she sold her soul to the murdoch boys for the glory spot assuming she even had soul to sell think about how stupid all of them will look when president trump is sworn in they will become major hit piece against his presidency	0
mr trump since the murdoch uber-left boys took over fox and elevated cruella deville kelly from the mid day slot to prime time slot ve had no use for her she wasn that great back then and she no better now and after the first debate ve had no use for foxe most of your supporters have sought out other news sources my two top picks lou dobbs and stuart varney on fbn they are great and seem to admire you and your efforts but like melania quit giving cruella the attention she is desperate to get don get down in the dirt with her let her wallow in it like the pig that she is ve cast my absentee ballot in az for you weeks ago along with millions of others the greatest revenge is to win and be our president go trump make america great safe and sane again	0
it cruella harry potter in battle for the hearts and minds of morons everywhere	0

she was cute until she went with the cruella de ville look guess she thinks it is more professional	0
might be tricky but if ailes takes the prime timers with him and others they might make new network fly he pretty smart knows the business then you have real choice but always watch fox business maria varney and lou dobbs would be about all that left for news junkie to watch without throwing up if murdoch thinks he can hold his audience with just cruella devill and brood of unknowns that his play ailes should take his stable of stars and go reboot with new network believe they make it fox will follow the establishment of both parties into hell with megyn leading the way maybe she vying to be hillary clintons press secretary who knows let see where these chips fall	0
admit kind of lost on this story ve been watching the convention and not paying much attention to other news what in the he is going on cruella deville kelly is now making accusations against ailes like carlson know the uber-left sons of murdoch took over the network after he retired right about the time kelly was plucked out of the mid-day news and made prime time witch but what is she saying about ailes and to what end also know the saudi royals own part of fox network wonder what kelly gave them for her elevated position and what top news woman poses for gq in slutty fashion like she did can you imagine diane sawyer or katy couric pulling something like that this is insane never could stand her or carlson something very devious and underhanded about both of them kelly does anything to draw the attention away from trump which means she been paid big money by the clinton cartel to turn on ailes and fox and promised big spot somewhere else back to the election go trump make america st great safe and sane again	0

ve seen companies shoot themselves in the foot many times apparently fox used disgruntled vapid former beauty queen- carlson to insure their demise it is widely known that the saudi royals own portion of fox it is widely known that rupert murdoch stupid british and his two uber-left sons started working on the destruction of fox about the time rm retired and the left the running of the network to the two bone-head sons at that same time the boys elevated cruella deville kelly from mid day news to prime time night wonder what she gave them for that it is not an accident that the uber left boys picked this time to oust as many conservative hosts in one fell swoop they are killary boys they will use this network now to try to stop trump and install their corrupt queen hillary as the president so that she fulfills every globalists wet dream don watch fox news much since the first debate where cruella and bret beair were told to take trump out their animosity towards him was shameful dvr reilly and as long as he doesn have on too many fair and balanced uber left idiots watch him dvr hannity same thing discovered lou dobbs and am now worried that his excellent conservative show will disappear off of fox business there is one very encouraging element in all of this the left now know that killary can beat trump otherwise there wouldn be this shake up of conservative news sources interesting that reilly has become very involved in history books and television at this time like he known this was coming for some time hannity has been saying for couple of years that he wanted to move to texas because taxes are killing him in ny and could give rat behind where the treacherous witch kelly goes wherever it is will not be watching ailes was the heart and soul of fox news and business he gave the talent-less carson her one and only break cruella is back stabbing lying witch but something tells me ailes is not finished in the conservative news business go trump make america st great safe and sane again	0

ve been thinking about how homosexualists target christian businesses for destruction approach florist or bakery or now pizzeria and tell the owner that this is for homosexual wedding and then hammer them with law suits enough already it time for everyone to calm down we need new approach think about this when some homosexual couple comes to your christian business for services at their immoral event don panic go ahead and take their business then explain what is going to happen next tell them that the food and services will be just fine and then inform them that all of the money that they pay for the services will be donated to traditional pro-family lobby if it is something like catering where your employees have to be there to provide services tell them that all your people will smile be professional and everyone of them will be wearing crucifixes and have the holy family embroidered on their uniforms then show them pictures of your uniforms when the truck pulls up speakers will be playing immaculate mary show them the truck and play the music oh you would be offended by that so sorry you approached us because we are christians right we are happy to provide services for you and we are grateful that you chose to come to our christian catering business we just want to be of help then tell them that you will take out an ad in the paper to let everyone know what you did with their money thanking them by name for their business so that you could make the contribution suspect this approach if adopted far and wide would put an end to attacks on christian businesses father	0

agree wholeheartedly with you whenever actually discuss doctrine--i much less forgiving to false ideas usually offer general plumb line for bible study so to speak which is broadly prophecy for israel and grace for the church if person is not offended by israel and therefore can understand what that premise means--then can talk with them but reformed theology rendered significant amount of anti-semitic theology by way of wrenching israel eternal promises which include promise of the land and replacing israel with the church not too dissimilar to homosexualists usurping marriage and replacing it with homosexualism what the confusion generally surrounds is errant teaching about law and grace in other words the pauline mystery which was hidden from the foundations of the world sic is not taught that is salvation by grace alone through the fidelity of christ alone-- aside from the law of moses was frank heresy in the fledgling church look at the judaizers and gnostics troubling paul and the others will confirm this he said that he would that they go the whole way with their flint knives of circumcision and castrate themselves israel remains under the law--due to unbelief when christians try to incorporate the law of moses into doctrine for the church--they have erred in grievous manner mainline churches tend to teach from the reformed position which all too often usurps god eternal promises for israel ro says that behold all of israel shall be saved sic which means what it means on the face of it that national ethnic israel--as nation--will be saved although according to the future context of that prophecy all of israel will amount to about rd of their population before the start of the great and terrible day of the lord daniel th week of years for israel the time of jacob sorrow or the tribulation--the likes of which the world has not seen before and had the lord not cut those days short no flesh would survive that not speaking about the destruction of israel and her temple in ad--nor is it talking about the nazi atrocities toward the jews--those are types and shadows of it the eschaton or some people call it the apocalypse anyhow always good to chat with ya strike rick strike mean fundamentals	0
you will please note that it is christians who are trying to mind their own business like the businesses of baking cakes and photographing weddings and designing t-shirts and floral arrangements and running bed and breakfasts and renting church halls etc and who are being attacked fined and drummed out of business for trying to freely exercise their enumerated right to their religious beliefs that they have held and that have been upheld by our laws for long before any so called right to deviant sexual practices much less perverse marriage rites was miraculously found in our constitution so it is the leftists secularists that are firing up the culture war just as they started it by finding right to murder innocent human beings in the womb of their mothers years after the constitution was written hence years since we find ourselves witnessing the fulfillment of st paul warning letter to the romans and we are delivered up to the homosexualists agenda would like it if the leftists secularists were content to have everyone mind their own business with the exception of abortion as you say if they would keep it in their bedrooms though still doubt that would be enough to appease the wrath of our lord who has greatly blessed this country that was founded with the vow looking to the supreme judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions oh well regardless of what either of us wants the chastisement is already underway	0
it about time that religious freedom became matter of popular concern and address up until now the debate has been dominated by the leftist toleration-police who made sure that all of us should be forced to tolerate behaviors and conduct that christians found to be repugnant and harmful the diabolical part of the arrangement was that toleration never flowed in the other direction just as christians were expected to tolerate homosexuality the homosexualists were never made to reciprocate is there to be only one unidirectional form of toleration is freedom but one-way street doesn true religious freedom mean being able to act in accordance with your beliefs and not have the state dictate whether or not you will be punished for it in accordance with laws that don allow for what you value if there is only going to be one set of rules that reflects secularist thinking then that not freedom if the expectation here is that the christian--in the name of justice--must be forced to stomach things he finds reprehensible shouldn the homosexualists be required to do the same and as for the state shouldn it be wise enough and prudently motivated to recognize and allow for the fact that not everyone is going to agree about everything	0

good post the homosexualists agenda marriage-equality falsely so called is double-speak for cultural engineering of the feminist rand the actual extant marxist feminist literature is outspoken since the late with the unequivocal intent of re-defining marriage to something that it is not the left perceives the family as the atomic unit of capitalism in order to overcome the western culture and oppress it under marxism the family unit must be deconstructed and reformed to the gender-bending dictates of the state an emasculated male is the goal man who will acquiesce to the feminist governmental structure the activists are not content with form--civil unions--which guarantees all same tax insurance and so on benefits of married people they force teaching of aberrant sexual behaviors and the supporting philosophy which is paradoxically presented in the form of supposed moral arguments ie they teach the kids that their parents are immoral if we don support and celebrate re-defined marriage and re-defined human being	0

the current situation amounts to working agreement among demons first the liberals and the homosexualists are perfectly content to look the other way where islam is concerned because christianity can be be beaten down and coerced theirs will be neutral attitude of non-engagement because right now they are more interested in having islam as de facto ally in their broader campaign to discredit and destroy christianity it is strictly short-term thinking formed in no small part by the fact that the liberal cowers before islam while he simultaneously pays tribute to it the muslims are perfectly content to remain silent while the homosexualist movement continues hollowing out what remains of the west judeo-christian heritage in order to replace it with its listless hedonism and when the time is ripe that will make islam open conquest all the easier the muslims will simply execute the liberals and the homosexuals and that will be it it is perceptive long-term thinking and the future belongs to them	0

agree on two points partially the push on same sex marriage was indeed not only from the lgbt activist groups without popular support such move would be impossible but that push was the cherry on the cake homosexualist and radical left groups have been working to achieve this dramatic change in public opinion for years the problem for homosexuals which you seem to understand well is that inevitably there will be backlash to such radicalization homosexuality is sin that has been in existence for thousands of years but never has it been acknowledged as marriage even in the most corrupt empires here we come to the second point of agreement accept your distinction of political and religious conservatism to an extent you as political conservative understand the craziness of pushing homosexualists main stream and the tyrannical impulses behind the movement however submit that all political conservatism stems from religious views all political leftism stems from the view that there is no god but man is god to himself that why leftists want to exclude christianity from the public square and am making guess that you must have had some form of christian religious upbringing that is the foundation for your political conservatism	0

marriage was promoted and protected by religion and the law to promote and protect men and women and the babies they make healthy two parent families are the bedrock of healthy society its biological fact outliers like gabor and her multiple marriages are rare exception social policy for can be determined by the homosexualists are abnormal most are dangerous perverts and can make babies they should be treated as such	0

averaging has clinton up in michican and in florida as far as ohio they say clinton by	0
see all of new england eventually agreeing to this colorado and oregon and new mexico under dem governor and if you can get michican and pennsylvania which have bills before the legislature to do so in then you re in striking distance	0
ohio is very much outside what would be considered normal voter behavior for reasons we can at least somewhat quantify as did above michican was complete outlier by every metric we have so wouldn consider either of them predictor of really anything moving forward other than the volatility of human behavior which may or may not work in favor for the campaign	0

american liberal elites completely out of touch with american labourers and american poor basically the democratic party said to them at least we re not republicans while offering no real solutions to their suffering consider also the state of michican where number of voters this election who cast ballot but did not cast vote for president that compares to undervotes for president in in other words it looks like people were not very happy about hillary or trump and outright refused to vote for them non-trivially large numbers	0
true story circa in westland michican new gas station opened up diagonally opposite an existing station both managers left their assistant managers with the instruction to keep the price of gasoline penny less than their competitor the starting price was something like cents per gallon the assistant managers kept taking turns lowering their prices until the price got down to nickel the cops finally ordered both gas stations to return to normal price because there were long lines of cars waiting to fill up idling on the side of the road in all four directions that the cops thought presented hazard	0
uh it little weird that this was unauthorized maybe it was quickly reported up to the chain of the national dnc whereas it was just the michican democratic party that knew about and authorized the test overall it good that the attack was detected people were alerted and it was stopped but someone dropped the ball in communicating about the exercise ahead of time	0
surprised you even believe there is such thing as global warming most of you conserative denialist want to pretend it not real just leftist fantasy apparently in your mind science is anti-american	0
you didn bother to look because you don want to believe it true such rabid denialist youre while agenda is falling apart you ve probably never actually been challenged in your horrendous belief system	0

simple way to avoid using the incorrect fun new pronoun is to simply avoid conversations with those who insist you use their fun new pronouns use the same method when confronted with anyone accusing me of white privilege or being denialist they were considerate enough to warn me that they were someone hazardous to interact with so return the favor by quietly minimizing my contact with them this lunacy will run its course eventually until then they can destroy your life and livelihood using the power of bureaucracy and so should be considered menace to both	0

as for muslim communities themselves if they hold that islamism has nothing to do with islam then there is nothing to discuss which is plainly not the case this position undermines brave islamic reform theologians such as britain usama hasan pakistan javed ahmad ghamidi and america abdullahi ahmed an-na im who are urgently trying to lay the foundations of theology that rejects islamism and promotes freedom of speech and gender rights thereby undermining the insurgents message refusing to allow muslims into the untied states until they accept freedom of speech freedom of religion and equality of women maybe the incentive needed to hurry through those reforms this denialist position also betrays the many besieged ex-muslim voices such as the pakistani-canadian writer ali rizvi who struggle for the right to be fully accepted by their own muslim communities these reformers all need vocabulary that distinguishes islam from the politicized distortion of it peddled by islamists and jihadists if ex-muslims aren fully accepted in their own muslim communities why expect other non-muslims to be this is why there are no go areas where large numbers of muslims live until muslims change they should not be allowed to immigrate into our country reversing this campaign will require decades of work by muslims and non-muslims alike but the endgame must be to render the ideology of islamism intellectually and socially obsolete don know about others but have no interest in spending decades trying to civilize muslims sounds like that old white man burden and rather leave them be let them fight among themselves just keep them in their home countries	0
the attack on data just seems crazily extreme can we see the unadjusted data sets for global warming adjusting temperatures is some kind of art compared to doing accurate calibrations of equipment next phase of the denialist warmer phase will be to argue they had errors showing where the sharp upward turn is new categories warmer denialist or denialist warmer pick side	0
anybody who uses the word denialist thereby demonstrates that they haven the first clue what scientific method is demonstration which is fortified by the apparent failure to realise that scientific method is all about making predictions and verifying the results thereof and scientific theory which cannot produce verifiable or indeed falsifiable predictions isn scientific theory at all	0

the reality of this debate between you and is that nothing say will ever convince you could give you bunk explanation and you say was wrong could give you the correct explanation and you say was wrong it called confirmation bias you are going to listen to and believe what you want to believe you could say the same about me but know about confirmation bias and inoculate myself against it if quote correct physics explanation to you you ll just go to one of your global warming denialist websites that has valid sounding explanation to refute what said and copy and paste it into your comment	0

sooooo let have look at the scientific expertise of the most highly regarded warmists and see how well their schemes work in the real world after all the measure of any good scientist or engineer is that what they design delivers the goods right but as that rabid denialist paul homewood writes on his blog not many people know that this particular climate scientist has consistent track record of utter failure regardless of how highly tom chivers thinks of his academic qualifications bits of paper for the last ten years professor trevor davies pro-vice chancellor of research at where else the university of east anglia has been promoting scheme called generation park to be built on some waste land near norwich this would burn straw pellets and so its proponents claim would achieve the following create jobs during construction and once complete would include new homes student accommodation an education centre research base acres of parkland plus new cycle routes and walkways would burn tonnes of compressed straw year to generate electricity would produce the equivalent of power for homes which would be sold back to the national grid or to city businesses while power firm on would capture steam produced to heat homes and businesses it is likely to only be new housing developments which would benefit from that district heating and the real clincher it would reduce norwich carbon footprint by and put the city at the forefront of carbon reduction and tackling climate change how could the people of norwich resist such an honour eh especially when they the team backing this project have track record like this professor davies was the man behind project to build wood-burning incinerator at uea intended to provide power and heat for uea after five years trying to get the contraption to work those bright sparks at uea have given up on bio-mass and converted it to burning gas with the result that its power output is now five times what it was when burning wood like the uea favoured windmills the wood-burner never achieved anywhere near its projected output though it did manage to increase their co emissions and deposited enough toxic ash on the uea campus for the dept of the environment to be forced to intervene the good news is that the financial backers including uea on and around other investors who are owed about million are set to lose in the pound of their investment what was that old saying about fool and his money the bad news is that natch lot of that money actually came from taxpayers like me and thee and from the punitive levies on everyone power bills including those of the poorest people in the country needless to say neither davies or his fellow prat keith tovey have accepted any responsibility for their utter failure to get their wood incinerator to work nor for their reckless squandering of public funds nor for the pollution they caused at uea and the surrounding area it hardly surprising that last year broadland district councillors who are being consulted on the plan deferred making decision on planning permission for generation park saying they needed more information on the environmental impact of the plume which would come out of the chimney as the whole project has now ground to halt and the board having called in an insolvency practitioner it seems that once again reality has driven another caterpillar through the crackpot dreams of the highly qualified buffoons of uea oh and thought this point highlighted by paul homewood sums up their sheer bloody hypocrisy to perfection campaigners including from the group say no to generation park had expressed concerns about possible pollution from the plant developers had said the height of the chimney would disperse emissions far from the city in other words don worry people we won dump that pollution on norwich we ll dump it on king lynn or yarmouth or hunstanton or spalding or some other place we don give damn about	0

for example think it misleading to say that on the issue of whether man is in some way contributing to climate change the science has been settled in favor of the alarmists it misleading because those of us on the skeptical side of the argument never claimed otherwise indeed that is the crux of why what dana milbank wrote is nonsense denialist is strawman made-up attack not based on reality the skeptics are not denying climate change can and has happened either natural or man-made what has always been argued is the quantity of that man-made change and the magnitude of the impact of more co on our climate the alarmists have taken threads of evidence and spun tale of doom its the narrative of doom that skeptics dont agree with and not whether there are some threads of evidence here and there each thread is argued over is ice retreating or not how much warming is really happening are the models correct or are they overstating warming the data supports the skeptics claims that models overstate warming so when skeptic admits to some aspects of the science of co on climate that not retreat so much as an assertion of where things stand scientifically to wit co has increased in the atmosphere in recent past due to man from around ppm in ppm in and will continue as we burn fossil fuels that product co there has been natural climate change since the dawn of the earth the earth has warmed in years some or most of that increase is likely due to the impact of co but natural variability plays some role as well science is not settled on exactly how much there has been little warming in the past years much less than models predicted as such it appears that models are likely overstating the amount of warming to come unless natural variability is reducing warming trends more than estimated one source of model estimation is likely aerosols as recent papers stevens suggest lower areosol warming impact another source of contention is how clouds feedback on the climate models have applied overstated feedbacks that magnify the impact of co on the climate and overstate the amount of warming we can expect further overstatements occur wrt impacts when minor impacts like drop in ocean ph is extrapolated into doom like acidification ph of vs is not acidification worth mentioning or sea level ris oops only mm per year similar with the false calims of extreme weather false assertions of himilayas melting or polar bears going extinct the list of false claims wrt global warming now include obama falsely blaming it for her daughter asthma which is anti-scientific bs if you back out those model overstatements actually get the closest to the truth that we can find co has some warming impact one that is benign and makes the world slightly warmer and wetter the current year trend has been decade and it is not accelerating we will stop emitting fossil fuels before ie before we go up another we will not burn up the planet co also fertilizes plants and so increases the productivity of the biosphere greening deserts and adding to bio-diversity there is no doom just bit warmer and wetter and greener world enjoy there is no denial just those who have different view of how the future will unfold the alarmists are wrong global warming is not crisis and the science doesn back up those who claim it is	0
sorry need your clarification the official adl ajc etc approved term is holocaust denier what exactly denialist mean is that new term because you overused the previous one	0

that is how it worked out etymologically though it should be tautology atheism means literally without religion it is taken now to mean an absolute denialist position against all religions antitheist would be better word it is the opposite of theist the belief that at least one god exists	0
okay how about climate change denialist is that fine because think it descriptive	0
since some posts below seem to depend on the science available from you-tube or the academy of happy tablets let look at the political climate pseudo-science known as agw or man-made warming but first when the term denialist is used what exactly is alleged to be denied surely only complete retard would deny that the climate changes the climate is always changing it always has and always will however the man-made warming hypothesis is exposed by honest science to be nothing more than political propaganda the man-made warming hypothesis tells us that the earth surface when heated by the sun tries to cool itself by radiating energy heat out to space on it outward journey some of this energy is captured by an impenetrable blanket of co allegedly caused by human activities in turn these warmed co molecules will try to cool themselves by radiating back this captured energy therefore the earth surface will receive the energy being radiated by the sun plus the back radiation from co causing man-made global warming nonsense this man-made warming hypothesis only works if one ignores the inconvenient fact that the earth surface has cooled itself by the outgoing amount radiated some of which may have been captured by co as for back radiation entropy law dictates that warmed co molecule will in turn cool itself by radiating it received energy in all directions so some will go upwards out to space some will go sideways again out to space therefore less than half of any captured energy can be returned to the surface if as we are told to believe it is only co produced by human activities which is responsible for the formation of an impenetrable blanket which captures and returns all outgoing energy even if human activities were responsible for all co present in the atmosphere nomatter how much political pseudo-science fiddles the numbers it cannot be unreasonable to observe that if the current total global concentration of molecules per million is correct then there is clearly molecule hole in the allegedly impenetrable blanket which can only increase in arithmetic progression nomatter how many millions of molecules are in the climate system in reality the sun is the earth energy source primary driver of the climate system and any alleged back radiation from co means only that as the earth receives back from warmed co molecules presuming that there was ever high enough concentration of co present in the atmosphere to form global impenetrable blanket in the first place less than half the amount that it has cooled by so it will simply take longer to cool than it otherwise would were co not present in the atmosphere we then must look at what percentage of global atmospheric co comes from human activities and as the total global concentration is parts per million or ths of of all gases present in the atmosphere if we are generous and say that some of this ths of comes from human activities that molecules per million which hardly warrants the vapourising of trillion tap washers per year on carbon reduction scams simply to appease eco-mentalists or to fund highly-placed individuals and officials using their position to protect their finanical investments in alternative energy if rising co levels could cause dangerous warming why does irrefutable satellite data show that there has been no warming at the south pole for years tropical oceans years months southern hemisphere years months tropics years months north pole years months australia years month years states globally years months mike hulme founding director of the tyndall centre and professor of climate change at the university of east anglia uea has been champion and exponent of post-normal pseudo-science for some years to serve his own socialist agenda and this is what he has to say about political post-normal science the danger of normal reading of science is that it assumes science can first find truth then speak truth to power and that truth-based policy will then follow self-evidently dangerous climate change will not emerge from normal scientific process of truth-seeking scientists and politicians must trade truth for influence ie tell lies what matters about climate change is not whether we can predict the future with some desired level of certainty and accuracy the function of climate change suggest is not as lower-case environmental phenomenon to be solved it really is not about stopping climate chaos instead we need to see how we can use the idea of climate change the matrix of ecological functions power relationships cultural discourses and materials flows that climate change reveals to rethink how we take forward our political social economic and personal projects over the decades to come from what hulme has admitted the climate change debate is not about truth and physical reality but way of making climate change the mother of all issues in order to achieve socialist and marxist aims including de-capitalizing the west and bringing about global governance by an elite climate scientists must learn as quickly as possible what will please this political elite and serve it up or their grant money will stop	0
someone here needs to do something but that one isn me you need to search reality ted cruz instantly became canadian citizen at birth as soon as his mommy pushed him out of her birth canal that instant citizenship made ted cruz natural-born canadian cruz had natural allegiance to the parliament in ottawa at his birth eight years later the congress conferred citizenship on ted cruz by the force of law when it repealed section of the immigration act had the repeal of that section not happened upon reaching ted cruz would have been required by law to do particular acts over several years to claim naturalized citizenship toadies who like ted cruz suffer from mind disorder cruz is scumbag for having run for the nomination of presidential candidate from the republican party as cruz never could swear the oath of office of the presidency cruz idiotic fans are worse than criminal hillary clinton denialist fans better luck next time	0
yeah that his spin great cut and paste every one of those name dropped publications has had an opinion piece where just facts was used it doesn make his facts accurate this is like using an opinion article from forbes written by heartland institute climate change denialist and fake climatologist james taylor in other words just facts is one step lower than when it comes to biased facts if you can get that low this poll was written with the sole intent of making trumpsters seem more intelligent than hillary supporters using questions that are intentionally leading and or ambivalent questions that libertarians who read and believe his past articles and talking points might know read the poll results article the high margin of error for each demographic is intentional so he can make the claims he does in the article no one else respects this guy except those who want to believe his opinions and what he tries to push as facts that why you will rarely find his name mentioned anywhere except in the libertarian conservative media bubble	0

so if soros is oh so different than most other globalists jews running international banking and media why are these moderate jews not using their media to condemn him calling for his arrest for funding terrorism and promoting racial hate via the controlled media along with calling for the seizing of soros assets we now have proof he is both terrorist sponsor and driver of racial hate and division yet crickets chirp on him in the media we expect moderate muslims to call-out and condemn terrorists we expects whites to do the same of those who fund and preach hate yet these tribalists will do nothing of the sort because he is of the tribe in fact they do their best to hide his name his true game and ethnicity in their controlled media we would not even know of his sickening existence if not for the internet he would be sold to us as charitable man or peace as his commercials both on fox and cnn of just few years ago tried to sell us but of course we know better not because of free press or media that is long since been bought out but in spite of the controlled media lets see jews come out worldwide and condemn soros en mass now along with the evils of globalism lets see them call for diversity like they have so many times elsewhere in both ownership of international banking along diversity in media ownership lets see them call for israel to open its borders like targeted white countries are expected they will not ever do any of this because in the end the vast majority support him and are tribalists never calling each other out no matter how despicable another fellow tribalist is let see the calls from moderate jews to end the international banking and media monopoly this one tribe has on both the true lets see the call from them to have hindus buddhists christians muslims and jews represented in these key arenas that control our finances news politics and laws equal represented according to population but no if fact call for true freedom and diversity like this makes those few with true tribal privledge scowl and call for silence of truth watch the reaction to this for proof	0

when oj was acquitted black americans cheered because one of their own had beat the system and got away not because they are inherently bad people but because they were tired of seeing those more privileged get off on similar circumstances while no such courtesies were offered to them it was born of frustration at being treated unfairly by the system rooted in injustice at least some feeble excuse can be offered to explain worrisome reaction to gross injustice today democrats cheer hillary for beating the rap but they have no moral justification and cannot claim that somehow democrats or evil white bitches for that matter have been getting bum rap this whole time she is the system an oppressor and the only reason she is cheered is because of her political affiliation those that are happy for her are tribalists with non-existent sense of moral justice anyone who thinks this outcome is just fine isn raging against the machine they re aiding and abetting oppression and injustice	0
good point roger that it would be confusing usage but still racist usage of course race itself is confused clumsy unenlightened unscientific concept very attractive to leftists tribalists bigots and other primitives who are too simpleminded or hateful to see people as individuals to see that phenotypic expression is continuum who need to collectivize everyone therefore confusion among its adherents is no surprise it is also used by people to compensate for feelings of individual inferiority by taking racial credit for the accomplishments of individuals who have similar skin color or whatever the alt right is good example mexican of course isn race in the classic sense but that doesn mean the razis aren being racist which of course they are many of the ones ve met associate themselves with the aztecs call themselves chicanos which many associate with being mestizo or indigenous and they dream of re-establishing aztlan supposedly an aztec word for what is now the sw us however ve been fluent spanish speaker for years went to college in mexico traveled extensively in spain and cuba and never heard it used in any way other than its simple obvious basic meaning the race the common meaning is the race and that is exactly what members of la raza have always meant despite what some of them now tell gullible english speakers who want to be misled anything else is reach if you say la raza to spanish speaker they re not going to think the people or anything else they re going to think race any claim to the contrary is preposterous and dishonest occam razor everyone here should go go to freetranslation dot com set it to translate from spanish to english and type in la raza answer the race change to translate from english to spanish and type in race answer raza now back to spanish-english type in la gente answer the people alt for the people type in el pueblo and take screen shots before the revisionist apologists and trump haters force them to change it	0

nation socialism was ethnodefensive for dying west this is obvious for anyone with critical thinking skills who agrees with oswald spengler analysis that civilizations rise and fall he wrote this big book years ago that said the west was in its death phase right after ww under these conditions things that are pushed as progressive appear which spengler said was nothing new like redistribution of wealth birth control power for women equality etc that this has appeared over and over in history right before civilizational collapse which is ultimately the point where the money powers take over rule by plutocracy which we have witnessed for the last years national socialism was an injection of strength into the west to take the power away from plutocrats and put it back into the hands of traditionalists tribalists if you don agree with this tough its the way it works pick your poison rule by money powers and watch things collapse current west or rule by imperium or authoritanism with strength and confidence	0

it is reasonable to have doubts for instance would cameron actually bring the issue of leaving before parliament if he did would the europhiles in his party and among the opposition vote it down in the house of commons if it gets as far as the house of lords we know there is majority of eu pensioners former eu staff and sundry other political class toadies to vote against independence the question is will the political pressure force the issue or can cameron push it into the long grass in the hope we might forget my own forecast is that brexit win of less than say margin will be used by the political class to carry out another faux renegotiation produce another non-reformation of the eu and then call another referendum with even more taxpayer cash or else just refuse to implement the brexit decision however beliebe small brexit win is the only outcome which will allow the conservative party tribalists to hold that party together if cameron resigns or is pushed will he have time to award all the honours he has promised to all those whp helped him in the referendum honorary knighthood for obama damehood for christine lagarde peerage for carney the list of stoogies is endless	0

eric you need to realize that the folks who run the country desperately need scapegoat for the impending economic disaster europe is the same why do you think they re allowing millions of illiterate boy-loving tribalists in it to give the average citizens something to focus on besides the utter disaster our betters have made of western civilisation	0
unfortunately this insanity will only end when the german people take the situation in hand their government is hopelessly invested in pc bs and will allow german women to be raped repeatedly like the brits did in rotherham rather than admit that illiterate arab tribalists will never assimilate	0

douthat trump proved that many evangelical voters supposedly the heart of true conservative coalition are actually not really values voters or religious conservatives after all thanks for stating baldly what has been obvious for decades these voters are tribalists first and foremost hiding their bigotry and cryptofascism behind biblical passages they do not even understand if the trump disaster does nothing else but sever the influence of these religious fundamentalists from our national politics and return them to the backwards southern swamps from which they arose we can all consider it favor	0

the imbeciles who voted conservative are the people who put them in position to continue destroying the country and stripping british children of their inheritance country of their own today many british children sit as strangers in the land that their grandfathers and great grandfathers fought for to hand down to them that struggle has been thwarted by host of imbeciles who voted labour conservative libdem snp etc	0
the people who are responsible for this are the imbeciles who have been voting for the mass immigration parties did you vote conservative labour libdem snp or any of the other mass immigration parties yes then you are to blame for the continuing degradation of the nation-state and the stripping away of the inheritance of british children without imbeciles like you none of this could have happened	0
james was at hustings last night run by local transitional group new name it seems for bunch of green activists we had questions including one on climate change and another on global warming thought the latter had been dropped in favour of the former but it seemed to be way of getting two questions on the same subject the audience didn seem to like the ukip policy for nuclear gas and clean burn coal plants the conservative also plugged nuclear and gas and roundly condemned windmills both met with stony silence green candidate wanted windmills everywhere no coal and no nuclear applause from audience libdem and labour both accepted more windmills as part of the mix	0
naive people do not get elected to state senate in their or become the majority whip of that state house at and rarely do freshman us senators do something as major as lead the effort to block the obamacare bailout that saved taxpayers hundreds of billions it singlehandedly stopped obama from creating backdoor national healthcare system by allowing insurers to simply overspend and get bailed out like the banks except it would be every year ironically if the libdem don-don is elected it will all go for naught since he wants to create universal healthcare system	0
if nigel and ukip were so toxic how come they got of the votes this equates to british votes farge is ukip so nearly million people voted for him another thing for you to think about is that the snp only got votes ie with the liberal democrats on votes combined votes for libdem snp	0
those useless politicians don need to wake up to the fact that our sovereignty has been abolished labour libdem fake conservatives and the snp are all well aware of it and are mostly not just in agreement with it but are complicit in it they just don want the people to realise it so they lie and they have the msm rupert murdoch and the bbc to make the lies seem truth and even if they didn have loads of billionaire and millionaire backers who all do very well out of the eu and it immigration policy to finance their propaganda they would just use the tax they take from us to propagandise us the people certainly need to wake up but they are comatose to anything but the x-factor and downton abbey	0
almost if not exactly the same as how the labour and libdem parties conduct business these days too	0
many labour legislators believe his left-wing views are out of step with public opinion and tried to unseat him yes but did they really hope to unseat him with their choice of contender really labour seems pretty much in the same boat as the lib dems and in more ways than one they seem to have run out of anyone with any credibility to put on serious challenge in the libdem case that they are not simply scraping the bottom of the barrel but have actually broken through to the rocks underneath is pretty evident as is the fact that they now seem in terminal and irreversible decline it is good sign for labour that they want to move away from the centrist position of blair and hopefully under may the tories will do the same because british politics works best with opposition parties that are opposed to each other not the people but for opposition politics to work the party in opposition has to have degree of credibility it has to be seen by the governing party that the opposition party through active reasonable opposition could win at ge it is this fear that helps keep governments honest and accountable the problem for labour is that while corbyn has left the centre ground he is so far over to the left and so entrenched in long ago past that tee shirt above about says it all corbyn in leninist mode that no one seriously believes he can lead labour to victory in ge indeed they seem almost less likely to win an election than the lib dems what the country really needs is moderately left of centre labour party and moderately right of centre tory party doubt we will get either since within westminster we still have that obsecenity the political consensus on the eu which hasn yet had stake driven through its heart so what we really need is for ukip to get its act together and start on the road to serious post brexit britain and we do need them if we look at the clues so far from may bojo and the like brexit will be one giant stitch up and we need ukip that will put in its manifesto exactly what it will do to correct the errors of judgement by may government with each passing week we ought to be seeing ever more remainers the remainers who believed in democratic eu but not in the eu we have and who were looking for signs that the eu could become accountable and were sadly disillusioned by the eu itself with its response to cameron repatriated powers and reforms campaign finally recognising that the eu will not now nor will it ever be accountable to the people and that it isn even what might be called benign totalitarian state instead it will sacrifice any and all on the road to what it wants is there for the taking by ukip with more than little help from labour and the tories	0
well that and being raving national socialist of course wish knew what effect tactical voting will have up here though by which mean that really don have the faintest idea and don think anyone else has either pretty sure people are lying to the polls because every single tory and libdem spoke to at the fag-end of the referendum campaign without exception said that they be voting labour to keep the nats out but whether that ll hold up not even sure can bring myself to do it when it comes to the crunch or how widespread that intention is geographically is anyone guess	0

us in ukip are probably the most misunderstood and misrepresented group of people this millennia immediately after the last election in which voted libdem because thought that they were pro-democracy sorry about that was lied to and clegg flat refusal to hold eu referendum switched to ukip their fb page had likes and the party was more akin to cottage industry things have changed lot since then instead of being driven miles to go leafleting now turned down because they ve enough help in the next council ward the tide is slowly turning	0
beautifully written accurate and to the point mr warner and do not mean to denigrate with faint praise if add that you are stating the bleedin obvious that so many of us have believed for long time both con and lab think they have god-given right to rule for different reasons libdem remain confused but aggressive having been allowed to cling to the shirt-tails of power for five years but mr unpronouncable may have done us favour possible explanation of what an hiv activist like the one involved in the fracas in kent the other week actually is surely this is sectionable and remember from my schooldays being told that in order to stand for public office you have to be not certified insane that lets out most of liblabcon straight away methinks and specifically ed davey for certain thank you for super article can we get it published all over the main stream media probably not but please keep on trying ivor macadam	0

as well as the insanity there is the stomach churning cynicism heard libdem on yesterday claiming that in the event of an eu referendum year olds and eu nationals resident in the uk should be allowed to vote he insisted this had nothing to do with loading the vote in favour of staying in if the uk voters do not get these bas ds out in may all is lost	0

more westminster bubble genital fiddling afraid sturgeon is the distraction the establishment desperately needed to sideline ukip and now thats largely been achieved as we are seeing increasingly the snp are becoming an irrelevance who will be frozen out by the big two when it comes to running the country miliband is no fool he knows scotland is lost for the time being and seems intent not to lose england as well and that means shutting out the snp he cannot afford for the scottish tail to be seen wagging the english dog sturgeon has served her purpose so now she and her party can be discarded back to the hinterlands of their own regional media although expect libdem style hysterics from them from time to time in westminster	0
left to go back to philadelphia good heavens that was bloody novela explaining all of the progress that had been promising one would assume that they got pissed off when edited in rather snarky comment about the hold up had feeling that it did not go through when did not hear from you since added please confirm that you received this after the snarky comment had included some gov regs over here about children under not being able to wear products made from vinyl containing pvc filates as for me came down with jolly good diverticulitis infection and am now on liquids have another acute situation in that area and am being treated by research team at the univ of edinburgh headed up by cousin they are all dead set against me starting up the company might add so they were not over the moon when they heard this news cousin was arriving from london monday afternoon so vacated her premises early monday so as not to be exposed to her libdem manifesto and am now staying with friend out in the suburbs it was he who lent us his house in florida it is half here and the scots docs have located research group in town where am about to have blood drawn when this is done it must be done by structural biochemist so it was quite fortunate that they found one more later have you reached the level of sheer brilliance as yet my darling girl xxxo	0
this pile of ordure should have been first in the bonfire of the quango promised by former pm david cameron will never forget the hounding of ukip over the bown business whilst that same outfit allowed some sort of libdem crookery to just sail on by even so politically motivated as it undoubtedly is might bite off something unchewable like second referendum in which many reluctant former remain voters switch to leave and increase the majority to with turnout	0

see telegraph have launched several attacks on their front pages this paper has sunk so low it will soon be in the daily mail category shame for allister heath who was great back in his city am days libdem funding cameron deeply concerned about farage race relation laws comments comments closed on both of the above what they should be writing about is how ukrainian oligarch temerenko who is openly warmongering and calling for more arms to be supplied by uk also happens to be conservative party donor just at the time when ceasefire in east ukraine seems to be holding reckon this is far more dangerous than misinterpreted farage comments on employee discrimination and relatively small cheque accepted by some libdem guy in nw london guardian and offguardian links with numerous comments are below	0
if you want foreign neighbour vote tory libdem or labour	0
believe some ukip supporters decided to hold their noses and vote tory for that reason whether it amounted to lot can say from the disparities between the opinion poll predictions right up to the very last days before the election and the actual results of the election suspect that some people who had been minded to vote labour and even libdem also made late decision to vote tory instead and for the same reason however don expect that many people in england who were minded to vote in would change their minds and instead vote out just because they heard that the scots were going to vote strongly for in as scots voting to stay in the eu would not be the same as scots voting for bloc of snp mps at westminster allegedly controlling the uk government headed by miliband and nor would the tory party being using the mass media to pretend that it was the same	0
that kinda funny ve been thinking about how weak obama is and how strong mexico is they have big economy bigger than canada their air force isn much but they do have large army the mexican goverment could just demand to go back to the borders before the usa stole their land then send troops across the border invade california what would obama do anything maybe nothing maybe he would hide again like he did during the benghazi attacks pretty sure the rinos wouldn try to impeach him not as long as their friends are feeding off taxpayer dollars and his libdem comrades will think mexico is certainly justified in this action trying to keep the latino vote in their districts	0
although agree with your sentiments think it only fair to point out that ed davey is not useless tory he an even more useless libdem	0
the article does not mention that lord fink is reported to give one third of his income to charity does miliband match this or anything like it by the way the article says witness david cameron controversial pledge to spend per cent of the uk income on foreign aid it is not just controversial but absolutely outrageous but to be fair it was libdem bill liberal democrat bill that protects spending on foreign aid has survived an attempt by group of conservative mps to kill it off with lengthy filibuster the guardian dec	0

on question time in october libdem mp tim farron said we have to get away from this nonsense that immigration is some kind of curse on this country it is blessing well don feel very blessed	0
if and when clegg goes off for well padded sinecure at our expense feasting on the gravy of eu commissioner post farron is quite possibly the next libdem leader he sounds like nus activist at some third rate poly studying sociology	0
there so many adjectives describing clegg can think of any that haven been used already the libdem manifesto is complete garbage and watching the daily politics and andrew neil destroying the libdem spokesman they really are dead men walking yes they will win couple of seats more than they deserve because of the nature of the british voting system but they are spent force	0
the deputy prime minister also said that every liberal democrat mp is barrier between nigel farage and alex salmond and the door to number downing street like in eastleigh you mean where the most recent poll has ukip con libdem lab so in eastleigh vote for the tory is vote for clegg edit oops just noticed it is april not	0
what if white man were elected congress who believed whites to be superior to all other races or the only real race wait that happened robert sheets byrd it was okay because he was libdem forgot only liberals are allowed to be openly racist and still play the race card my bad	0
having quietly and calmly read through the main article which one of the best obituaries of the eu have read to date couldn but mention an additional point successive british political governments labour then tory libdem coalition and now tory have all for their left and right tribal purposes all been as one over their love of the rotten borough that is the eu therefore posit that the establishment who actually control the left and right wing parties have been pushing the eu agenda for their own purpose that of continuing the defrauding of the british people via ignoring the will of the people they the left and right wing polticals and of course their pimps in the msm have all been in it together while they still live the despicable lie so do not for one minute think that the establishment are not part of the the problem of the british people being defrauded day in day out	0
this is the kind of thing that ukip will also face in any seat where there seems to be serious chance of its candidate winning the old parties will have no scruples about colluding to try to block the ukip candidate conservative calls for voters to back libdem the chair of tottenham conservatives has written to voters in his neighbouring constituency urging them to vote lib dem to keep labour out	0
looking at the trends in the most recent polls it seems more likely that the tories and libdems might just about be able to continue with their present coalition rather than ukip being in position to decide whether or not to prop up tory government that shouldn really be the case given that taken across the whole country ukip support is about twice as high as libdem support but it the way the electoral system can work when you have fptp in single member geographical constituencies and the lower overall support for one party is more concentrated into certain constituencies than the higher overall support for the other party	0
in my constituency the conservatives have real chance of throwing out the libdem mp but ukip are pretty much nowhere hoping some more polls will come out before the th but as it stands having real battle of conscience	0

ukip have good following in cornwall but it is evenly spread so it is unlikely they will win any seats however the fairly good news is that the ashcroft poll few days ago suggested that the libdems will be wiped out making cornwall labour and libdem free on second thoughts that is very good news	0
sadly no live in beautiful somerset can tell you that here it tended in the past to be choice between libdem and conservative suspect the greens will do well in bath the one thing people who are honest comment on though is their sense of shock when they go to london there is feeling of total disconnect between the west country and the capital think the conservative vote will be down in rural somerset because both the farmers and the retirees feel let down by david cameron and hardly anyone likes the eu but oddly posh tory candidates still do well hence jacob rees mogg	0
could have summed it up by saying labours plan is unbelievable and the conservative plan is unachievable libdem plan is more of the same this means either that the british public will be duped or it will take its collective head out of its collective arse and vote for something that will deliver ukip policy is to basically put the country back to what it was before the rest of them made it into what it is today but then to take it forward into true global trading powerhouse which the others have shown themselves as being incapable of thinking about let alone doing each of them have hung their hats on what they call an internal single market and have tried to convince people that being in one restrictive market is better than being in all markets with the freedom to choose who we deal with and what we buy and sell to us who will be voting ukip there is nothing to fear in being like all other nations who are not restricted by eu bureaucracy there is certainly nothing to fear about allowing this country to have investments made into it by the whole of the world	0
brexit was the modern-day peasants revolt it has resulted in convulsions in the conservative labour libdem and even ukip parties with establishment figures losing their lustre and it has given impetus to european anti-establishment parties the political class needs to have severe kicking every so often otherwise they get much too big for their boots talent or intellect	0

ve been at our local hustings in malvern this afternoon our ukip man did pretty good job but harriet baldwin con will almost certainly get back in because the neo-marxist vote is split ways we have very slimy green mayor who is standing for parliament the labour and libdem men were vying with him to see how far left they could get however when our ukip man said that there been no global warming for years the other fell silent and one man clapped me heaven forfend that do get elected to the local council that green mayor gives me the creeps	0

if you look at the polls reports on sky news they are all over the place one has ukip and libdem level pegging the next has ukip with twice the proportion of the vote that the libdems have either they don know or they are making it up as they go along the whole thing gets more unstable as the date gets nearer	0

yes emg and others there is scope for us to hit lot harder well we might as well and my fellow ukipers have been canvassing for almost year in richmond surrey and most of what we receive are comments like waycist cum you should be ashamed of yourself yes ve had that one lot because the libdem luvvies of richmond already believe us to be so so we might as well shout the truth of what is happening to our fair land from the rooftops however if you are able to and you are already ukip member the nec is coming up for re-election and it would be good opportunity to get new blood and new people in who know how to run something perhaps we need to start to own ukip ourselves more by putting our own hands up because if we don we leave the way open for people who think ukip is an easy way into politics to feather their own nest think we have few such in ukip don mean nf at all but possibly some of those who have been or who are trying to be around him	0

slightly away from the article but what most resent about the left and the progressives in the uk is their permanent sense of righteousness they re worse than religious group that thinks it has monopoly on holiness say anything against leftist dogma such as multi culti doesn work or worse still that you don actually like it and you get deluge of personal abuse current one is people who can think for themselves in the uk we seem to have divide along the lines of labour good and nice libdem idealistic and nice conservative nasty and selfish green young and fresh and ukip racist there seems to be an assumption of easy virtue voting labour or libdem makes you not only nice person but also you re doing your bit for the poor it so good you don actually have to donate money or give up your time you just pop to the ballot box every now and then and do good and if in addition you loudly assert how much you hate racism you are occupying the moral high ground to such an extent you re out-of-sight this moral glow has the effect of making them firstly unable to question any of the dogmas that make the people who proclaim them nice and secondly it gives them permission to be rude and bullying to people who disagree	0
its easy for someone who sits in bubble isolated and insulated from the rest of us to say the economy is good gas prices are low praise obummer newdog seems like either wealthy recluse cretin or paid libdem shill uber likes to use these people to go into forums and try to shout down any nay sayers for the most part these are paid shills probably in india who comb the internet for articles on uber and then use fairly standard script to outnumber detractors you can look forward to seeing alot of that as election time gets closer and closer	0
when you ve quite calmed down here are some maths to ponder based on turnout of about no will need about million votes to win so at the election there were about ukip votes assume they re in the bag now add onto that about of the tory voters who say they are minded to vote no that another and on generous reading now add in of labour votes that another so that comes to million votes meaning we need to find another million among libdem voters green voters plaid and snp voters as well as not pissing off the labour tory voters who are minded to support us but are self-evidently also part of your liblabcon progressive metro-elite stuff do you think really those people are going to respond to your or indeed farage rantings	0
there simple way to reduce labour votes put up libdem posters everywhere and tell your lefty friends how great they are of course you will still vote ukip or tory but only tell that to those who vote likewise	0
there are more horny pandas than libdem voters	0
using pr voting and based on the votes cast at the last nation-wide election for political party seats at the eu elections in may ukip would have seats labour tory green libdem the rest so how come this bbc rubbish about ukip being minor party rub the libdem nose in it by pointing out that the greens beat them by votes and ukip beat them by million votes some minor party	0
received the generic uklp one about month or two ago then yesterday received three uklp tory and libdem all personally addressed to me which was bit disconcerting are they allowed to take addresses from the electoral roll now ve never seen this before	0
same here no tory no labour few posters excepted but far fewer than in no libdem for that arrogance alone they should not get single vote	0
it makes no difference whether labour or tory get in downing street they are both eu poodle parties who are too immature and incompetent and voluntarily castrated to handle even the leftover that brussels permits them to debate if you vote labour tory or libdem then you are guilty of guaranteeing the continuity of this rotten status quo there is only one party that can enforce change even with just few seats and that is ukip	0
read the articles you know absolutely nothing about canadian cuban rino fraud cruz your the typical afro libdem pretending to support reformer	0
reddit is libdem central there contrary views aren allowed unless they re approved including the post you just made	0
the libdem one is hilarious james could just recycle that one for our democrat party	0
have to disagree with this in my experience libdem voters supporters are closet snobs who talk about the great unwashed and shop in waitrose	0
can identify with your take my would-be labour mp is decent sort although weak and the con mp is pleasant enough but am with zanzamander above feel betrayed by all of them libdem included not least because of their mass cave-in to what facilitates islamism and its terror tactics this time will vote for ukip only fool would vote for any party which is and has been complicit in the ruination of the country and wholesale sell-out to sharia	0
today in blind panic most of the newspapers and all the main parties are begging us to vote tactically to keep out another worse than us party pathetic this is what it has come down to none of the main parties can win outright and they know it having failed to make positive case for their own party so they resort to asking us to vote so as to keep the other lot out vote for labour conservative or libdem is vote for no change more years of uncontrolled mass immigration more loss of sovereignty to brussels more borrowing more debt wasted billions on foreign aid unnecessary vanity project of hs and your constituency mp voting how he is told by the party rather than representing the interests of his her constituents if you don want more of this if you want change there is only one vote that could bring that about don waste your vote on any of the no change parties don vote tactically vote strategically for this election and for the next vote ukip	0

that correct ukip standing down in few key marginals in the province in many respects the dup would have common ground with ukip on number issues if deals are to be done the dup will likely support the conservatives any notion of supporting labour along side the snp would be an anathema for me blukip coalition would be the best possible outcome but suspect it may come down to cons libdem and dup if we don end up with an unholy progressive alliance	0
it will be interesting to see to what extent the election is similar and how many shy tories are now shy kippers the cynic in me says not many id guess most are on the libdem side of the tory party not the ukip side	0
they have rigged the polls now watch them rig the elections beware folded ballot papers ukip is always on the bottom and easy to cut off or fold out of sight beware the pencil on the string in the booth easy to rub out and remark only take and use your own black ball point pen for those invited to watch the count check all spoiled papers be very suspicious check to make sure those with crosses are in the same ink paper with pencil cross and biro cross has been voided by second person check no voting slips are hidden in the wrong pile and remember there are hidden cheats in the counters unfortunate but true even in sleepy old wells in somerset in the last ge libdem slips were hidden in the tory piles so beware be vigilant and share all your knowledge about vote rigging and remember the electoral commission are asleep at the wheel happy voting	0

ah yes project pledge makes its debut expect more pledges wait till nearer the day the really significant pledges will be the joint ones from mr cameron mr corbyn mrs sturgeon mr juncker and oh that libdem bloke because they will be joint ones just like the scottish referendum they will have absolutely no legitimacy never having been put before parliament in separate vote and there will be absolutely no way to hold anyone to account for either keeping them or abandoning them what kind of pledges or offers can we expect will they include unilaterally rescinding any of the accession clauses will they include the unilateral withdrawal of our armed forces from any joint initiatives which are not negotiated via nato will they involve the non-recognition of eu passports awarded to non-eu citizens outside the uk borders will they include the refusal to be bound by ttip as being against the fundamental interests of the uk if the remain side offered to exit the eu if only we would vote to remain please would that restore our confidence in our political classes and the bona fides of the eu	0

there is every possibility of religious war here not least because the devoutly ignorant might see it as their duty unless the government in power listens to the indigenous population all around me see muslim sensibilities over-accommodated while they can insult complain and demand and yet the needs of many of my neighbours are ignored that does not bode well for community cohesion my neighbours cannot even complain about the privileging of muslims in my town many of whom can or won speak english many of whom are on benefits because they refuse to learn english or are too stupid to do so for fear of being accused of racism at the same time under the guise of freedom of speech islamists are given free rein to crank up the ignorant in muslim communities in spite of the government insistence that this is not happening that happened in bedford uk recently when hizb-ut-tahrir was given platform alongside other supporters of islamist terror by the libdem council there to tell the muslim audience among other things not to be proud to be british my cousin lives in bedford he was disgusted and so was we would not have been had we the opportunity for return match in which invited speakers could be open about how we see the threat from islam here to all that is free but no the speakers would probably have been arrested	0
indeed the landscape is changing with labour just about dead with the libdem can see many more switching to ukip would expect ukip to hold the balance of power at the next election if the referendum result goes the wrong way labour will never form government in the foreseeable future and their need to get into bed with the snp will ensure that people in england don vote for them for fear of having jeanette krankie telling us what to do	0
another example of libdem denigrating women unless it is hillary then the blindfolds go on thank god for the blindfolds	0
james sometimes concentrating on the damage such things as wind turbines do to our people does the trick by driving up the cost of electricity they literally kill the old the poor and the sick whenever we get harsh winter during last year election the libdem woman she reminded me of shirley williams woolly hair woolly mind accused me of being climate denier as if that was knock-down unanswerable argument was able to quote the fact that managed to stop wind turbine above my town used the arguments that it didn match the demands for green energy as it didn produce much energy and it wasn very green for example it would kill barbastelle bats animals rare throughout their uk range it would kill birds and should be measured not just on its reduction in co we smashed the libdems it can be done jf	0
one irony keep finding in the uk and probably the us is the way that libdem labour democrats traditionally supported by the poor support these schemes which benefit the reasonably well-off at the expense of the poor first the poor tend to live in rented multi-occupancy accommodation with little or no roof or garden it is the roof-owner typically suburban dweller with large house and or large garden who gets the tax breaks secondly tax breaks are of little use to the poor as they tend not to be paying so much tax uk income tax nowadays cuts in once the annual income is above about so high-income household with large garden could claim subject to some upper limit several thousand pounds in tax breaks credits or equivalent bribery whereas the poor cannot utilise tax breaks	0

weasels like former bnp activist nick lowes now director of hate not hope have the audacity to buddy up with islamists and islamofascists whilst accusing libdem lefties like nawaz of being far right like to see how nazi nick lives with death threats the disgusting cowardice of the left in the uk sees them prostrate themselves at the feet of bullies whilst sneering and attacking those with the courage to stand up to them	0
that because the best most competent of them infiltrated the tory party let be honest cameron is libdem made few edits	0
most of them vote for libdem pretending to be conservative they just like its new socialist friendly outlook its not just islam using the left to further their aims its the globalists as well globalist communitarians up until now the major political influence in europe up until now hence the fear hence the dirty tricks dept going into overdrive	0
you are living in cloud cuckoo land if you think the conservative party is not finished as political force its over for them they are going to be having their libdem moment at every by election and general from now on	0

have absolutely no time for the libdem branch of the liblabcon cartel to defraud the public but if charles kennedy was little worse for wear if his speech was little incoherent if his words made little sense and showed no sign of any joined up thinking so what why criticise charlie let face it he was no more incoherent and stupid than almost every liblabcon politician they have on that leftie dominated programme or the non-political guests like writers musicians and various other multi-millionaires who strangely enough always seem to see things through their red-tinged socialist non-political spectacles anyway we have enough isms in our country racism ageism welfarism what is it when they criticise charlie boozism shame on them	0
these would have to be libdem voting viewers which in the scheme of things must be dying breed and insignificant in numbers don mind that kennedy fool on tv at all he personifies the lack of coherence	0

cream of the crop rotflol to pick grapes and lettuce to deliver takeout clean bars after closing time domestic work and day labor guess what they re already doing that work and will need to be let back in right away if we don want the economy to collapse as trump said they do work americans don want after all he called romney mean spirited and maniacal for his immigration plan precisely because it called for permanent self deportation trump is lifelong libdem putting on an act to get elected that all	0
have some honest questions regarding your name does independent imply your political affiliation if it does what separates you from liberal dems is there single issue upon which you agree with conservatives am staunch conservative however there are issues that can readily admit agree with the liberal viewpoint about for example opposed the idea of constitutional amendment defining marriage and essentially outlawing gay marriage opposed it not because am pro gay marriage but because am pro constitution and our constitution puts limits on government not individuals is there place where you align with conservatives or is the independent name just cover for being libdem	0

not nice but for goodness sake not to be taken seriously is it she is not seriously offering libdem policy of gender elimination so any sensible person will ignore it on the other hand she does belong to gang of fools who are ready to crucify anyone who says anything that is not progressive enough for them so perhaps we should all release the hounds on her	0
apparently executive member of numerous libdem committees in no way represents the views of the libdems whose views does she represent then and why was she appointed to so many libdem committees if her views were not those of the party who appointed her	0

oxford city council hasn had conservative councillor on it since current makeup of the council is as follows labour libdem green and independent the city is the nd most expensive area to live in the uk after london you would require to borrow times your average salary to obtain mortgage average price of semi-detached house is just over so the rich don vote for any type of conservative around there	0
james joking apart you could pretty well substitute labour or libdem for the greens without making too many amendments to the rest of the text depressingly some of what you write in jest may well come to pass	0
but you re perfectly comfortable with kelo and taking property for private use if you support the libdem trump don even mention the constitution is he threatening cruz with blatantly frivolous suit to defend the constitution of course not it political theater like his entirely unconstitutional threat to single out muslims the orange messiah is complete fraud and fat grotesque old goon four years of looking at that face and the entire country would be nauseous	0
but backsliding and backtracking is her forte so wouldn take too much of what she promises as commitment and even so nobody going to kick her out by delaying article the whole of the house would welcome that so she would be safe until the next election and then she can overcome the general election because labour are out of the game and she will push ukip aside by again warning of labour libdem snp threat if people vote ukip and split the vote and by promising potential ukip voters and other sniff at brexit again in other words she will use the same stance cameron took in the election	0
the dubs amendment was voted for by all labour and libdem mps no surprise there and against by all tories except for five traitors whose constituents will hope take note the amendment provides for children sic to enter britain biologically children are defined as human beings between the stages of birth and puberty not teenagers many of whom have already been islamically brainwashed from birth the ex-archbishop should ask himself why christians rarely go to church these days and why so many of them are under threat especially in the middle east he is hand-wringing do-gooder left wing socialist and an appeaser of an alien religion that wants to destroy the very christianity that he purports to represent he should be thoroughly ashamed of himself	0
moved away from jack straw utopia of blackburn nearly ten years ago my vote didn count then and certainly wouldn now was tired of being enriched by angry young men and now live in the country trouble is folks out here have never seen how truly awful it is in the towns and cities they still vote libdem and see nothing of the truth we outsiders see we need to spread the word out to the sticks and fast	0
he is of course absolutely correct the media and tv have outlawed ukip as the bad guys and every tiny little transgression has been blown out of all proportion when we have paedos racists diane abbott etc and thieves stealing taxpayers money in tory labour libdem parties who are not labelled by any of the broadcasters or newspapers completely biased campaign has been run but it will not stop people voting ukip who have all known it would be dirty campaign as the big parties are feeling threatened and terrified of losing their gravy train ukip will still rise above the dirt and come out victorious of that have no doubt	0
sometimes think that farage is just too polite when asked about other party candidates he could have mentioned the rochdale edit dudley tory who tried to con his electorate with fake edl march or the mep who defected to the tories amidst massive publicity until it was discovered that he was about to be kicked out of ukip because of serious irregularities and hasn been heard of since or the libdem candidate who has admitted deliberately infecting himself with communicable disease which will cost the taxpayer some per annum to treat or malcolm rifkind and jack staw instead he kept it general no names just numbers in most contexts such discretion is to be applauded but when you are facing an establishment which is fighting for its life at least one glove may need to come off	0

the libdem pravda can go farook themselves	0
exactly harry was conservative until years ago joined ukip years ago and have never regretted it for moment on our local committee we have an ex libdem and know several ex labour members in the party what is exciting about ukip is that probably the largest group of members have never belonged to any other party before	0
absolutely correct vindician by voting conservative one is voting in support of of what labour libdem and greens consider to be correct policy all the mainstream parties are in agreement about far more than they are in disagreement they all favour the sort of big-state intrusive hierarchy that imposes them their bossiness and their nannying on the rest of the population adults and children alike vote for mainstream party is the acceptance of citizen subordinate status to his political representatives and of his willingness to be treated as child for the rest of his life	0
yes indeed fred on one side of the modern political division are those who believe that society is best led by the decisions of powerful and intrusive hierarchies and this includes the whole of the labour and libdem leadership the greens and the nationalists and most of the conservatives on the other side are those who believe that this outlook is denial of the essence of humanity and that if we adopt the stance of treating adults as though they are oversized children then nation of oversized children is what we will end up with think that an observation of what has happened over the last years should lead us to conclude that the latter camp is making sound point	0
this is tragedy for his family and they have my condolences however am sick and tired of all the eulogies coming from the westminster bubble this man was drunk and given different circumstances would have had seat at the cabinet table he spent years in parliament and did nothong of note other than take blair to task over the iraq war as libdem leader he must have know about cyril smith and like steele ashdown and clegg did absolutely nothing measure their party and politics the msm knew he was drunk and said nothing- this man should have been exposed for what he was years ago	0
get rid of your labour libdem and progressive politicians insist conservative politicians put britain first	0
right where do begin in one of the most employable fields going but we ll ignore that for the sake of this argument hope you realise the point of that argument is that eastern european countries have harder time getting research grants right in very sadistic way that good thing for western scientists for example in about three out of four erc starting grants out of went to researchers hosted by institutions in the uk germany israel france the netherlands and switzerland secondly there are hundreds of other sources of grants that not the only eu government-backed grant you can get finally the point of university is to obtain skills that you wouldn otherwise have and put you above other candidates if candidate from the eu has better set of skills than me think it totally fine to hire them over me it the same way could move to germany or scandinavia and do the same also how is voting con lab libdem voting against the status quo voting ukip is against the status quo	0

labour are running scared now they are asking libdem and tory voters to vote labour to keep ukip out not so long ago it was vote ukip get tory	0
take your point and did read all the text of that petition before replying to you indeed it was the text that reminded me of that lorry driver you see think that cameron has not just failed his responsibility as an elected government official to protect the united kingdom national security because he actively has worked for the eu interests and against the uk interests and think most other members of the tory labour libdem parties who might replace cameron as pm will carry on as cameron has	0
trump is the war on women words of wiz dumb from libdem faux news bimbo	0
that libdem one lies the others swears to it	0
the people of south thanet have missed an opportunity to put genuine star of politics into westminster and have instead voted for tory automaton assume that there was tactical voting by labour and libdem voters but this is not the end for nigel but the beginning he should remain leader as shown by ukip share of the national vote and return to fight another day	0
tories need left of which were tory last time were labour were libdem absolute majority for cameron no help needed but with the dup doing they ll have good buffer	0

cameron first act on taking office in should have been to start dismantling the bbc and sending shot across the bows of channel until the left-wing propaganda units that masquerade as state broadcasters are closed down right-of-centre parties will never win an election instead cameron pandered to the biased broadcasting corp by installing fat pang effectively libdem and failed to challenge the left-wing bias it took farage to do that of course farage only one ball but that more than cameron has	0
correct me if wrong it seems to me that ukip pulled from labour labour pulled from libdem angry at their lefty party previously joining con while con remained as it was the moral of this is ukip voters hold the balance in some marginals con take notice	0
will say it again cameron has now lost the libdem excuse for watering down conservative policies his grass roots should now demand it am not holding my breath though think it was bad night for democracy	0
have just been watching tv news to get some results information and what saw depressed me as if it wasn bad enough already what saw was the political and media class talking to themselves and each other again and talking load of nonsense it is quite clear that apart from scotland these results represent swing to the right not the hard right but just swing away from silly lefty stuff ukip and the conservatives increased their share of the vote while the libdems and labour went down yet we have on our screens and insulting our intelligence journalists and politicians insisting that labour lost because it wasn left wing enough and libdem voters defecting to the conservatives or ukip because the libdems had supported right wing government why would people vote for the right if they want left are these people thick or are they so indoctrinated that they can see the wood for the trees	0
school children are good means of propoganda they believe it and go home and tell their parents who accept it they grow older with received views of eu integration except it doesn work the best voters for ukip are the elderly with experience of life and the younger voters with imagination the poorest are managers in big business and most of the public sector although this is changing outside whitehall if ever you canvas or leaflet for ukip or against the eu ignore homes with long gravel drives and volvo at the top they ll be labour or libdem	0
the conservative mep who defected from the liberal democrats well there you go anyone who ever had anything to with the sexual deviant libdem party can be dismissed as irrelevant	0
me too but think we are lacking honesty from those who profess to be political parties the libdem and most probably labour are hardly in favour of the monarchy imagine party of the right that was voicing these motions people voting for the left-wing dross might think twice it was just passing thought as for myself would very much like to see christian party of sorts doesn even need to be headed by nuns bishops and clergymen just needs some direction that most people even atheists can get behind and appreciate we are after-all under political attack by pro-islamic culture	0
are you labour or libdem mp	0

as far as have been able to tell did research the term but results were inconclusive the origins of the alt-right is white supremacy cannot tell whether the term was political label placed on such individuals perhaps originating from academia or whether such group created it themselves however there does seem to be fringe alt-right group who have embraced the terminology as their own who are white supremacists and often anti-semetic too didn come across the term until hillary clinton used it in speech she gave and get the impression many others heard it for the first time then as well at this point in time she associated the term with breitbart readers and so it is possible many folks believed its definition to be one that is consistent with the average breitbart reader values perhaps those who are not politically correct and believe in sovereignty and the nation state are not against immigration but are against mass immigration without proper controls etc there is website can remember its name of someone who has tried to break down the current alt-right into alt-white white supremacists and alt-west those who share lot of values with white supremacists but are not anti-semetic do not believe white people are superior instead believing that they should have the right to exist and value their culture and heritage just like every other group from the way the terminology of alt-right has been used get the impression it is mostly to undermine and condemn anyone who is not progressive the deplorables just like the terms racist xenophobe islamophobe etc in brief moments of amusement have entertained the idea that the use of the terminology is due to terms such as racism no longer having the desired effect	0

can agree at all lifelong fiscal and constitutional conservative have no doubt that there were bound to be few muslims in the usa that celebrated and obviously this occurred openly in gaza and few other nations but that an absolute world of difference from thousands and thousands supposedly dancing in nj streets celebrating to me it makes big difference whether presidential candidate or even more importantly an actual president speaks of what occurred accurately trump did not he grossly exaggerated or totally conflated video of foreign celebrations with it supposedly happening here in the usa when it never did it has nothing to do with trump being try and brand that person racist and or islamophobe again and again or anything like that it has to do with expecting candidate for such an important and serious position to be accurate in his claims or to at least admit his error if he accidentally makes false statement in other words it not about racism or any phobia it about honest and integrity character and it very disturbing to see these problems with trump over and over again if he just made such statements as private individual or even on low brow reality tv who care but as presidential candidate it not excusable especially when he not only doubles down on it but attacks reporter who effectively says my article didn say what you claimed it did and the reporter was exactly right yet trump mocked him like jr high school kid would that not strength that immaturity and again it has nothing to do with race or any phobia it has to do with honest and integrity with getting basic facts right and owning up to ones errors all of which seems to be very problematic for trump	0
as though denying the very obvious--islamic terrorism is essentially worldwide plague--isn bad enough much of the liberal leftist media tries to downplay or even deny the existence of radical islamists but of course when someone of prominence trump etc says they saw accounts of muslims cheering for example throngs of palestinians were seen on video in jubilation upon hearing of the attacks instead of acknowledging it happened the lefties media scumbags immediately try and brand that person racist and or islamophobe again and again can only speak of what happening here in the us but assuming the leftist media operates much the same way in the uk	0

the coming war on freedom of speech germany provides glimpse into what might unfold in the uk and in many respects is already happening unbeknownst to most right now the msm internet and social media are falling into the hands of an ever-shrinking group of mega-corporations all with globalist politics many with power and wealth greater than nation states they are now political entities and are conspiring with national leaders to suppress free speech and distort the narrative to fit the globalist agenda the same process is happening within the world mainstream media msm msm social media government collusion in germany merkel primary concern is and always has been shutting down dissenting opinion to the globalist open borders multiculturalism pc agenda her talk with zuckerberg at the un that was overheard was only about censoring political speech she disapproves of anti-immigration anti-islamisation not tackling islamic terrorism look what the media does it lies whenever this hot mic story is brought back up here one example daily express stated last year german chancellor angela merkel was overheard at the un conference questioning facebook commitment to combat posts and pages which condone terrorism emphasis added this is an outright lie to distort the narrative away from what is really going on censoring dissenting political speech and rewriting history to make it look like merkel was actually tackling terrorism unbelievable then this new truth get quoted and spread until history is rewritten and the old truth enters the realms of conspiracy theory nonsense leftist public shaming war guilt tactics anyone who disagrees with the leftist-globalist worldview is labelled far right even liberals who think enough is enough when it comes to mass uncontrolled immigration and the many legitimate concerns this brings up security economics integration crime etc they are taking advantage of german war guilt for cultural marxist social engineering on scale never before seen in european history the minute someone says far right or even right wing the implied association is nazism and this is key people then self-censor or back off due to war guilt or fear of being charged with pc thought crime bigot racist islamophobe nazi etc never mind that nazi is short for nationalsozialistische deutsche arbeiterpartei national socialist german workers party and was collectivist-statist and has more similarities to the modern left than any conservative political views this is an inconvenient fact obscured by the myth of the left-right political paradigm myth created and perpetuated by leftist academics merkel hired an ex-stasi officer to collaborate with social media giants and far left groups to censor all speech that she disapproves of these far left agitators go onto peoples facebook and engage them and try to entice language they can then report as hate speech people are getting fine of up to euro peoples accounts are getting shut down all over europe including geert wilders leader of the largest party in holland and europe most outspoken anti-islamisation critic it gets worse combined with the police they are also raiding people homes and confiscating computers and phones from people who have committed thought crimes online even worse are new attacks that this has spawned all psychological warfare to terrorise the german public into not expressing any views that differ from the pc party line for example leftist social justice warriors are reporting hate speech to employers and unions trying to get them sacked many have been people faces quotes and personal details are being copied and shared online as form of outing hate speech even using the mainstream media for this with hunt which has led to people getting death threats there have even been incidents of people having their children taken away by the state to protect them from the corruption of hateful views of their parents state complicity in attacking own citizens finally to demonise the right even further the german state is colluding to sabotage lawful peaceful protests they plant saboteurs within the crowd at the cologne pegida march to give the pretext of violence so they could shut down the protest with violence then the media conspires by showing very one-sided story to make other people scared to protest and to make all pegida look like violent racist thugs this has been exposed in few articles likewise the government and media conspire to suppress information from the public on the pretext of not fanning the flames of far right extremism which even led to cologne being suppressed for days until the alternative media forced it into the open massive public square and train station in major city but no cctv footage now we know why merkel ordered for all the footage to be erased another example is the spd socialist party in germany paying antifa antifascist thugs euro an hour to demonstrate as with the uaf in the uk they mainly act as saboteurs staging counter-demos starting violence then shielded by the police who then attack the right-wing marchers they also infiltrate marches pretending to be nazi to start violence which then gets blamed on the peaceful anti-immigration marchers as always the media collusion rewrites the story and this becomes the new truth pro-migration marches are always shown to be bigger than they are anti-migration marches only show the speakers or the edge of the crowd and the numbers attending figures are always exaggerated or downplayed accordingly the media cameras always focus on the few skinheads but ignores the vast bulk of mainly older working men women and entire families as similar trick to the showing of refugee women and children despite them being the tiny majority even according to idled official stats some shocking evidence and further links on the following article this type of things is now being reported all around europe demonisation of non-pc critics and politicians this is before we even discuss how all the leaders of parties that are eurosceptic or anti-immigration are being targeted with lawsuits tax probes investigations faked media controversies etc geert wilders three times marie le pen twice another pending tommy robinson arrested to prevent him going to the birmingham pegida march then leftist media demonise him the list is endless speakers are prevented from entering the uk on the phony basis of not conducive to the public good the uk has banned pamela geller robert spencer geert wilders and the ban donald trump petition fiasco meanwhile to take the example of the hypocrisy of just one university oxford it lets in hate preachers and encourage them to speak to our youth justifying it with we have to allow them to speak so we can counter them whilst banning free speech publications and cancelling anti-islamist debates because it might upset the muslims this is real political persecution that is going unnoticed by the public because the msm is utterly biased this is massive assault on freedom of speech social media msm and expression marches speeches points to degree of totalitarianism most of us thought disappeared when the berlin wall was torn down make no mistake the enemy is not islamic terrorism its nationalism patriotism any resistance to cultural suicide indeed it an attack on freedom itself public shaming threats to kids jobs censorship and deletion political persecution fines for political speech sabotage of rightful public protest blocking entry of speakers and politicians the return of state-sponsored brownshirts historic revisionism it all happening but in the name of political correctness the modern doublethink term for totalitarianism ironic then that the state that calls normal citizens nazis don be fooled into thinking it can happen here it already is and will see new assault on our basic freedoms references copy and paste into google to fin the article referred to

hamas-linked cair announced in press release that it today announced the renewal of its share the quran campaign in response to republican candidate ben carson false claim that islam is inconsistent with the constitution great idea all for the public having better understanding of the qur an people will read the qur an and see that it is book of peace and tolerance and that ben carson is an ignorant islamophobe right well actually it unlikely that hamas-linked cair really wants anyone to read the qur an at all if people did read it carefully and attentively they would see that it is not book of peace at all and not compatible with the constitution just as carson said so why is hamas-linked cair giving away qur ans ostensibly to counter carson given that the edition they give out is massive coffee table book that weighs nearly six pounds it is even more clear that they don really want anyone to open it and start reading they just want non-muslims to contact them and ask for the book so that those non-muslims will feel themselves to be tolerant multicultural and inclusive	0

what short-sighted and uninformed argument pro-muslim you sound like an islamophobe just by that remark so what if he is do you really think the muslims in the philippines are as vindictive as the one here in the that country has long history with muslims back in its pre-hispanic period when they were the unconquerable and managed to keep them in check for decades despite continuous insurgency in the south it should remind you with similar case as in sri lanka think that says lot about the strength of the country could you say the same here many countries that are now part of eu and un used and still do to demonize and lynch muslims whom back then they called the derogatory term saracen and anti-western just because somebody swears on western international bodies makes them anti-western do you even think that the us eu and un have clean human rights record duterte just grazed portion of that hypocrisy but won list them here because don want to feed on your ignorance read up on their records and be informed the fact that they are staking their claims on sovereign nation then makes them more hypocritical doesn it guessing he doesn want some globalist bs dictating his presidency he can do what he wants with his country he was elected there with million voter margin for reason the filipinos wanted change and change is what they re getting what wrong with lessening drug crime anybody who can do what marshmallow obama can is refreshing in my eyes	0
am so tired of people like obama throwing around terms like racist bigot islamophobe etc they are all terms used to silence people but if being concerned about swarms of immigrants coming to my country who hold supremacist murderous ideology makes me racist then so be it ll proudly wear that badge can only conclude from all of obama words and actions that he wants americans to die he just doesn care he was elected not by me to represent our country our people and he done everything but that people like him will not change their wrong headed stubborn arrogant ways until their own policies personally affect them when these migrants come for his daughters his family like they are doing in germany sweden and all of europe basically then maybe then he might change his mind	0

time to kill the great beast of islam below is an an extract from our free e-book the undoing islam in its own words you can read the rest or download it all here for the full stiry read our book islamic apocalypse part nine the way to kill the beast quest for the truth these days anyone who criticizes islam is branded an islamophobe in fact all that most of the so called islamophobes are actually doing is expressing an informed concern that islam poses real threat to our free democratic society the islamic state has frequently justified its reign of terror by referring to the koran and hadiths and what their leaders say appears to be theologically correct if islam were truly religion of peace then their sacred book would surely make them peace loving filled with love and inner tranquility but it doesn some of the terrorists reportedly know the koran off by heart so it can be verses of peace and love going round in their heads as they murder innocent people the koran says what it says about terror and no one can ever change it there is no point refusing to accept the truth we have to deal with it for the sake of the future of our free society we have to focus all conflict into debate about ideas and ideals and stop it being physical conflict the ongoing failure by our governments to do this is causing groundswell of true islamophobia that fuels right wing groups who are more than willing to overstep the boundary of peaceful protest that helps no-one peace love and respect it is clear that the koran incites terrorism terrorists read it before going out on mission while people believe in islam and propagate it and the koran is read terror will continue misfits with aggressive tendencies are easily drawn to islam which through jihad offers them religious justification and focus for their violence because it all done in the name of islam allah in obedience with the koran all other moral considerations go out the window if we don speak up now and point out what is theologically and factually wrong with their religion more and more young muslims will fall into the snare of radicalisation many muslims have been indoctrinated with islamic beliefs that cause them to despise our western values take not for friends non-muslims they are indeed all liars never be helper to the disbelievers obey not any non-muslim even the police or the authorities or any non-sharia law islam hates the west our free lifestyle and values it very actively teaches that hatred to millions of muslims can tolerant society overcome intolerance the koran teaches muslims that they will be successful and that non-believers are losers the statement those who disbelieve the way of allah he will make their actions fruitless can be pragmatically scrutinised and proved false there is not single islamic nation in the world ten most prosperous by overall gdp indonesia is the first islamic nation coming in th just ahead of the rather unreligious netherlands who have similar gdp but population nineteen times smaller and it is not because muslims are not hard working it is because islamic culture and sharia law hinder economic growth are there not thousands of muslims begging risking their lives to get to europe the usa and australia to find work many non-muslim countries are more prosperous than islamic nations this is an undeniable fact we have to show muslims the koran is wrong as soon as muslims understand that the koran is not perfect and infallible they will start to doubt that it is the word of god and then their confidence in carrying out jihad will fall rapidly it really is as simple as that human rights and human wrongs islam was invented in the dark ages by man raised in pagan spiritism initiated as medium to talk with demons who became religious warlord during his life he killed thousands beheading hundreds of jews in single day he had sex slaves and child bride he even burned people alive in their homes for not attending his religion prayers after his death the religion was propagated by war taking over large part of the earth its advance was only stopped by the greater power of the europeans in africa and asia as well in europe as islamic culture never underwent anything like the reformation or the enlightenment its holy book the koran was never subject to the kind of logical scrutiny that the jewish torah and christian bible have been put through it is only now in our day that critical attention is uncovering its violent xenophobic and misogynist prescriptions in fact its content does not even stand the test of truth it contains grave errors of scientific historical and literary fact gross failures of logic and much self-contradiction book that claims itself to be perfect and infallible but is so full of flaws lies even it cannot possibly be the dictated word of an all wise god its allah wants followers to destroy kill and plunder all who disagree with it its prophet promises each of them personal demon this is not faith as we recognize it today islam and its holy book fail the test of reason which it should have been subjected to centuries past and as result can only fall it is only matter of how long it is up to us in the west to decide whether it will be slow torturous demise full of barbarity from islamist groups like isis and boko haram or whether it will be sudden information technology driven worldwide social transformation	0

the danger of the religion of peace mantra it is irrelevant whether there is moderate islam or if islam is the religion of peace it is irrelevant what the good muslims think or if you know bloke at work who is muslim and is not like that irrelevant all that matters is that there are radical muslims and that they believe that they are carrying out the wishes of allah or emulating the beautiful pattern of conduct of muhammad it is irrelevant if their interpretation of the uran hadith and sira is correct or not they believe it to be so everything else is debating the semantics or an exercise in sophistry as non-believer should care what muslims think or feel about my concerns over the threats posed by islam if their feelings mean my children are in danger stuff feelings who cares about the good muslim at work your friend knows the only muslim you need to understand and use as an example is the prophet muhammad for he is the perfect man and must be copied by all good muslims without exception so what other muslim do you need to know flawed mortal or the great prophet himself all that matters is that the radicals believe their interpretation is correct they act on it and their actions have the power to impact or endanger your life and are fundamental threat to western civilisation all that matters is that it is forcing us to make societal changes which are detriment to our way of life and the civil liberties we inherited from ancestors who spilt their blood to protect those rights and that lifestyle moderate islam the religion of peace all mantras enforced by the creed of political correctness which are logical fallacies and are castrating western civilisations and their ability to even recognise the danger let alone combat it as such the first and greatest enemy to all of us is political correctness itself and this enemy cannot be combated with bullets or assuaged with money the only solution is for each and every one of us to realise we are all guilty for allowing pc to control our society and we are all equally responsible and capable of doing something about it you are not guilty sorry yes you are and so am each and every time you catch yourself about to speak your mind and censor yourself because of pc you are guilty each and every time you see hear or read something which you know is wrong but you fear some silly label islamophobe xenophobe racist for making fuss or even pointing it out you are guilty each and every time you are with people you know and you bend your conversation bite your tongue couch your words or even lie about your actual thoughts for fear of social stigma isolation judgement you are guilty each and every time you censor you make concessions to pc you are stitching another patch on the quilt of political correctness which has descended on all of us smothering and constricting us we are all guilty we have all contributed patches we have all stitched ourselves up and now the quilt is almost all-encompassing and the only way to atone to change this situation is to pull it apart patch by patch and it starts with picking and teasing out and exposing the first threads and pulling hard guilty as am this blog is my attempt to make up for lost time all the years being unhappy now recognise as cognitive dissonance but unable to put my finger on it accepting things that fundamentally disagreed with on subconscious level wrestling with myself to be more tolerant open minded understanding etc enough so what to do share links have conversations refuse to be cowed by fear of labels or the social isolation or stigma that pc threatens resist anger and emotion and deal only in fact and logic realise and accept that peoples negative reactions to your truth-telling is result of social conditioning to political correctness and that it is not personal just do something each person you get to wake up is victory just as valid as any other nobody is keeping score resist political correctness more on	0

really that the biggest outrage reading breitbart for years let take step back here milo wrote an unflattering review of the abominable reboot of ghostbusters which itself was nothing more than to push phony sjw agenda that bastardized seminal movie from my childhood then when anyone voiced their disapproval and the low box office numbers well we must all be sexist and misogynists to not fill the theaters to watch this masterpiece so leslie jones proceeded to launch scathing expletives and vitriol at any criticism so she not some innocent victim as you say not defending her getting hacked because no one deserves that but milo didn say anything worse than she did and got banned and oddly the right-wingers seem to always get banned while liberals get free pass for saying the same or worse but that another matter next you mention commenters and again don condone racism or sexism and ve certainly seen comments that curl my toes back but that not exclusive to breitbart that the whole internet ve seen just as much venom on left wing sites and youtube comments make them all look like nursery school teachers but we were talking about articles not comments was going to reply with list of all the racist hateful articles on the salons mother jones and huffpos of the world but hey breitbart beat me to it so hillary wants to paint the alt right as bunch of gun-toting toothless racists to distract from all her major failures and corruption by singing the same old vast right wing conspiracy bs ve heard from the clintons for years yawn and you re happy to drink the kool aid here little truth for you hillary is the poster child for the establishment the establishment on the right is no different so this is not left vs right thing it the people will vs the establishment the alt-right is not ignorant and racist as you posted it simply the people on the right who reject the status quo and false republicans like paul ryan mcconnell bill kristol et al who have lot to lose if their gravy train ends hillary is the same as george bush in terms of foreign policy she basically neocon and war hawk so of course they want to demonize the people who are against business as usual that has been screwing us for years any opposition is met with immediate ad hominems that mao and stalin her speech was utter nonsense and even many democrats said so so you don have to like everything on breitbart but thankful for sites like this and other alternatives to cnn msnbc and the rest of the bought and paid for mainstream media that only toes the party line and are all in the tank for the criminal hillary like to read many divergent viewpoints and watch what candidates actually say out of their own mouths and decide for myself don need the msm which is quickly making me feel like it becoming the korean news service to tell me who said what and what that means that doesn make me racist misogynist xenophobe homophobe islamophobe or any other manner of bigot have no problems with anyone except the close-minded and unfair	0

many of those lefty cretins are sofa dwellers much like the members of the uaf and would probably be hard pressed to prove they ve done an honest days work in their lives they want the mass immigration to ensure the lack of jobs so they can use it as an excuse not to work but are too thick to realise that most of these illegals coming from calais will sit on benefits indefinitely as well they don seem to understand that the benefits system is under such heavy strain more immigrants means more benefit payouts and less money available for these idiots who want them here the right wing low turnout in contrast is often due to most of their members working when these demos take place also as others have pointed out there is lack of freedom of speech in this country and supporters of right wing groups often face being sacked or subject to constructive dismissal for their political views in lot of industries therefore they can afford to have their faces plastered all over the media this is on top of being labelled racist islamophobe and various other names that have absolutely no bearing on the matter since britain is feeling the strain due to sheer numbers and it has nothing to do with what race the immigrants are fascist is always the one that amuses me though when it comes from the likes of the uaf and other left wing supporters who are hell bent on silencing right wing supporters on final note to that stupid woman we owe them nothing at all we may have gone to their countries to take the resources but in return we built their cities their services their system of government and their economy without us they would be living in mud huts like the tribes in the amazon completely unable to trade on the world market as they do today they train now to become doctors engineers and tradespeople because of what we have given back to them if anything they owe us	0

at last some official admission that we who are fighting islam were right all along you folks in the uk and europe need to do something and fast from new zealand here is my solution define islam in law as exactly what it is an ideology that promotes and encourages hatred and violence towards those outside of it goodness knows we have years of proof of this and an estimated million people and counting killed in the name of islam there is proof out there that islam it is an ideology not religion and so should therefore not be covered be religious freedom laws proof in the above link look at the link amount of text devoted to kafir that us the koran devotes of its text to us the supporting data is shown at the above link too no so-called religion can devote almost two thirds of its most holy book to those outside itself and yet still call itself religion if write book that is rds about mountaineering can claim that it is about knitting proof islam covers huge range of everyday things almost all of which are not religious have look quote fields of islamic jurisprudence criminal economics etiquette hygienical inheritance marital military political theological only this one is religious see it could easily be proven in court that islam is an ideology back to my solution having passed the above law close all mosques and islamic schools they are centres for the propagation of hatred against non-muslims set up deprogramming centres for muslim children they can be shown that the koran is nonsense there is verse in it that says that there is forbidding barrier between fresh and salt water kid you not that verse is wrong and since it is wrong the koran can not be from god there it only takes one pin to pop balloon and have just popped islam use the same law to ban immigration of anyone who follows an ideology of hate immigration to the west is privilege not right ban the proselytising of islam under the same law these laws are tough but better this way than civil war these measures are common-sense and they are based on fact check out this page quote so there is nothing positive in the quran for non-muslims period and there are verses in the quran that are intolerant to non-muslims verses calling on muslims to make war on non-muslims when non-muslims read the quran and don like it sometimes they re accused of having an unfavorable view of islam or being an islamophobe or they may be simply accused of hatred but really what is there to like about any of this if you re non-muslim exactly and if you want to see the above hateful verses the above page has links to them	0

in today world one cannot state the obvious lest they be ridiculed by the left islamophobe homophobe racist or whatever judgmental term the progressive imbeciles come up with progressive fascists are much like lemmings being led by the emotional appeals of their betters because five unelected judges on the supreme court arbitrarily decided that gays and lesbians can marry in spite of thousands of years of tradition and law we have people who are religiously bound by their conscience not to bake cakes for gay weddings or perform ceremonies for gay weddings being told that they are worse than criminals why not because they are bad or hateful people but because they resist radical destruction of civilized society personally am an atheist and don care one way or the other about gays and lesbian matrimonial matters but protecting the exercise of ones religious conscience seems like something worth protecting when it does no harm to gays and lesbians but of course the pea brained liberals in our midst will only stand for the rights of those they agree with and so in the liberal mind we must not offend muslims because their belief system is more in line with the fascist progressive mindset submit or die	0

below is column by well respected columnist diana west on the subject of barray insane obama and ted cruz ineligibility due to them not being natural born citizens she basically lays the blame on the cowardly republican party all of them especially the tea party crew read and weep for your country questions about natural born citizen are natural by diana west january mark levin and andrew mccarthy have taken strong positions on the constitutional eligibility of sen ted cruz for the presidency in fact they assert there is only one position that cruz is eligible and further that it is wise of cruz to laugh off the question mccarthy and that questions about cruz eligibility are for the kooks levin the issue recently resurfaced after the washington post asked donald trump about it trump remarks here suggest it is anything but wise for cruz former solicitor general of the state of texas to tweet sitcom clip in response to such an important question can imagine what is frivolous about the subject either particularly given the body of legal and historical evidence indicating that to be natural born is to have two american parents plural some cruz biographical background us senator rafael edward ted cruz was born in canada to an american mother and cuban father possibly canadian father if wikipedia claim that father rafael cruz became canadian citizen circa is correct ted father would finally renounce his canadian citizenship and become an american citizen in ted renounced his canadian citizenship in lawrence sellin further reports cruz came to the with his parents in but no evidence has been provided to indicate that his parents filed crba consular report of birth abroad of citizen of the united states of america form with the government or if ted cruz was issued passport prior to entering the country all freedom of information act requests filed to obtain documents confirming the true official citizenship status of ted cruz have been denied and will remain sealed until he agrees to allow any such records to be released cruz should immediately release these documents regardless of the precedent for stonewalling set by barack obama meanwhile the legal matter is hardly clear-cut to the point of it being stupid levin or specious mccarthy to discuss or seek the candidate response surely citizens have the right to weigh the bona fides of their presidential candidates without being dismissed as kooks no doubt my reactions are antiquated after all president obama has always laughed off questions about his eligibility he produced completely laughable piece of computer-created artwork purporting to be copy of state-issued birth certificate and only after donald trump come to think of it sought its release going to the public with yet another matter of national importance that political and media figures continually blacked out still despite having compounded his fraud and deepened his mystery obama laughed on he also seized the next news cycle with the killing of osama bin laden didn matter doesn matter not to the press from the left to right excepted not to elected officials arizona maricopa county sheriff joe arpaio excepted and not to our brightest constitutional scholars ve written from time to time about this giant taboo issue over the years and honestly don know of another syndicated newspaper columnist who did the silence was that thick indeed some outlets that regularly carried my column also regularly spiked it when various aspects of the obama eligibility saga were my topic this included the washington examiner it not that don believe you diana do top editor there told me some years ago just don want the examiner to be responsible for blood in the streets seriously in public though anyone who broached the topic was birther kook levin names for those who may have questions about cruz eligibility using left-wing arguments against conservative is unacceptable levin declared isn that exactly what he is doing is that wise maybe it hardball politics in that stigmatizing ideas with buzzwords such as birther islamophobe red-baiter is one way to chill any discussion indeed levin injection of this perjorative into his radio discussion was quite stretch given that there are no questions about cruz birth in canada not as there have been about obama birth in hawaii and later after his sojourn in indonesia his citizenship status as levin made very plain nor should there be indeed he seemed to be exhorting his listeners to be on the lookout for dissent now if you re solid conservative if you re reaganite if you re constitutionalist now the time to see who is writing what to determine whether they are serious about their principles serious about restoring this republic serious about the constitution and serious about conservatism or whether they follow cult of personality reaganite references aside what does levin mean by cult of personality am not entirely sure unless he is possibly referring to trump supporters my endorsement is here if so that is disappointing it would also seem to suggest that levin believes cruz eligibility could only be of concern to trump and trump alone not for example to voters or more ominously to the dnc already rep alan grayson d-fl has vowed to challenge cruz eligibility for the presidency might other democrats join in is it really likely that democrats would be as shy and retiring read cowardly as republicans were vis vis obama many many more eligibility issues breitbart john nolte came up some other possible ambushes exhibit the clintons are the original birthers if they went after obama over this issue who doesn believe they will go after cruz exhibit high-profile democrats are already vowing to sue over cruz eligibility exhibit the white house proved yesterday that at the highest levels democrats are fully prepared to make this an issue exhibit we re still waiting for independent verification that cruz mother was indeed an american citizen wouldn now be good time to drop that shoe however it falls update the cruz campaign released the us birth certificate of ted mother here it possible that obama presidency has set the precedent that puts cruz in the eligibility-clear regardless of extensive natural born interpretations that include american parents plural but just because obama got away with so much there is no guarantee republican would get away with thing mccarthy doesn think such litigation would matter he writes the answer to that problem is so what top government officials get sued all the time it comes with the territory and has no impact on the performance of their duties indeed dozens of lawsuits have been brought seeking to challenge president obama eligibility they have been litigated for years and have neither distracted him nor created public doubt about his legitimacy in fact most of them are peremptorily dismissed it worth remembering that this was largely the case because as they say the fix was in certainly the hoplites in the media locked ranks to prevent even the most sensational aspects of these court challenges from breaking into public consciousness and which if covered professionally almost certainly would have created plenty of public doubt about obama legitimacy imagine for example that huffpo cnn stephen colbert and the gang had all led with the story that evidence was introduced in georgia court to prove that the president of the united states own social security number came from connecticut state he had never lived in and my favoritie did not pass e-verify if this were republican president of course the saturday night live skit would have written itself complete with punch line straight from the presidential defense lawyer argument nothing in the constitution makes participating in social security prerequisite to serving as president after the studio audience stopped guffawing anything might have been possible even an impeachment inquiry concerning the possibility of felony fraud democrats are different though it not kooky to notice such terrible things it not going all kinds of crazy over the birther issue to reexamine the definition of natural born citizen either it only natural diana west is journalist and columnist whose writing appears in several high profile outlets she also has website	0
you can take this to the bank cruz will drop out over this natural born citizen issue he cannot hide his passport documents for fear that he will be labeled deceiver just as obama was for sealing his records when those passport records are exposed cruz will be toast trump will cruz into the nomination from diana west well respected journalist who writes for many publications questions about

hearing republicans suddenly recognize that there is growing income disparity in america one that they have denied or ignored for the past generation is to me like hearing child in revelation over the truth of the tooth fairy they seem stunned and amazed that their free market non-regulated economy would do such thing income gap gosh how could that be br br it is absurd for them to claim at this late date that they did not understand that the tax regulatory and budget priorities that they fought for and defended over the past years helped to create this ever increasing gap they again depend upon the stupidity and short memory of voters to sell this new income gap anguish that they have begun to peddle br br bushwah buyer beware	0
so here is the truth about the wonderful so-called productivity of american workers br br productivity is essentially working people into the ground and not hiring enough workers to do the work it looks good because fewer workers more profit br br bushwah br while the media blame it all on the newer technology or computers replacing humans driverless cars household robots and all that the real culprit is companies not caring for their workers so the answer is host of impossible care policies it would be simpler if companies simply realized that human beings who work for them need to be treated with consideration how convenient that the media blames computers now isn it br br when the last straw breaks the camel back the camel sits down and won go any further the american worker has been pressured for generation--it is is time to strike back and sit down like the camel and refuse to get up until there are protections for workers again	0

lib er al ism r- the state or quality of being liberal political theory founded on the natural goodness of humans and the autonomy of the individual and favoring civil and political liberties government by law with the consent of the governed and protection from arbitrary authority often liberalism the tenets or policies of liberal party an economic theory in favor of laissez-faire the free market and the gold standard other dictionaries agree with this one the disorder is failure to read them leftists are not liberal they promise liberte as they remove individual rights in favor of the needs of the collective spread the good word	0
having more money than they could ever realistically need while others starve according to how was raised that is immoral that what you said the only people who equate being rich with greed are leftists my friend in co is worth is he greedy find him to be very generous and you are using wikipedia as source really any crackpot can go in and edit anything it haven for leftists the poverty that exists in this country is mostly in the cities run by democrats for the last years pres johnson war on poverty has spent trillion since and black poverty is worse now than in you can thank obama for that not my fault and don much care perhaps you should give the constitution and the declaration of independence read the founders said life liberty and the pursuit of happiness it doesn say anything about limits on that or federal controls our constitution is charter of negative liberties it says what the government cannot do to you but since you are such europhile and you think france is so great go live there with all the newly minted algerian terrorists they seem to have everything you need and want why stay here america will never be europe thank god and given france pathetic performance in both world wars and that we had to save their bacon twice think lot of disrespect is in order british and american forces liberate paris and de gaulle had to march up front during the liberation parade the vichy were so pathetic that the british sunk what was left of the french navy because it was about to fall into german hands and french troops collapsed when they foolishly fired on american troops landing in algeria in as far as the french helping america during our war of independence they were late because washington and the congress didn have the ransom money for those french ships the french even screwed up their own revolution setting the stage for marxism in europe so much for liberte egalite fraternit the equality of opportunity you speak of is myth when one child can inherit tens of billions of dollars while another born on the same day has absolutely no access to quality housing education healthcare food and water equality of opportunity is very real you gotta be tough enough to go out and get it america was not built for progressive metrosexual sissie boys you re bleeding heart liberal no one is guaranteed good life ever and no one is starving here either when the government screws up the water supply it because of the epa or the detroit government the government provides social safety net that pay for the fact that there is still poverty in the liberal-run cities means the money is being mismanaged or stolen by the democrats but remember you ll always have paris and you can always go back here looking at you kid	0

the democrat party formed to back the left during the french revolution liberte egalite fraternite the terror they sat on the left but the real meaning is lies leading to terror any accused fell to the guillotine the french left is what marx engels began with and improved the lies got better marxism led to both communism and fascism brothers who fight still came from the same mother the democrats invented polygenism to explain why slavery was moral polygenism said each species and each race is created separately by god adam and eve were white god gave all others to whites in genesis and god blessed noah and his sons and said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth and upon every fowl of the air upon all that moveth upon the earth and upon all the fishes of the sea into your hand are they delivered they had to ignore the story that all who can speak human languages came from one population in genesis tower of babel this lie kept slavery and caused the civil war after losing the war and during the science debate between darwin monogenism and agassiz polygenism democrats used polygenism to create jim crow race segregation laws and anti-miscegenation laws this is what the scope monkey trial was really all about also americans changed the name polygenism to creationism those laws lasted until lbj lbj saw he was losing so he switched from segregation to feeding minorities like pets and removing their guns in cities between our civil war and lbj hitler used the same polygenism pseudoscience to preach hatred of jews and slavs to german christians darwin and haeckel any monism german for monogenism were burned in the big book fires democrats continue to divide the various races while claiming it to help other aspects of fascism by leftist democrats control media education political money for speech health care natural resources by federal protection words people are allowed to use pc science climate is only one area leftists lie to steal lives the footing under the foundation holding up thousands of lies is calling others what they most closely resemble nazis	0

right wing people have been scientifically shown to be more likely to be infected with teamism where it really is true its ok if republican does it it goes with their nationalism streak and how they chant in unison and demand everyone wears flag pins where we say dont wanna wear flag pin then fucking dont its meaningless gesture anyways not like you are doing fucking thing	0
totally agree but the religious right have been like this since the dawn of religion its who they are fire and brimestone teamism authoritarian and as long as you walk the walk they cheer they are the ones who mainly hid the pedos in the churchs the are the ones that constantly forgive their own for things they dont forgive others for and lot of this could just be said to be right wingerism in general	0
such loop we put our selves in associating with one team or the other gives you the ability to say something like that and totally dismiss the rest of the implications of the situation the polarization is working eaither side cannot admit to when theirs faults teamism coining that shit rn	0
thats teh difference between ideology and teamism	0
its one of the worst aspects of first past the post voting teamism and the right do it to an exceptional degree they really dont care who trump is as long as the liberals lost	0
the right dont give fuck its more about teamism with them	0
more than dems the gop has lot to fear from ranked choice they win lot due to teamism but lot of their team dont like the party more than liberals dont like dems	0
dont think we can without going to ranked choice voting so the right can have multiple parties that arent the dems the right are more naturally drawn to teamism yes both sides do it but its those people who like to chant about nationalism and uni-culture and assimulation well they tend to be bit more fanatical about it and while that might seem like negative attribute in our system it means more of them turn out to vote than on our side despite we have higher numbers	0
with ranked choice we could have multiple conservative parties that dont depend on the rnc and looking good to their base and they cant hate liberals as much as the next conservative guy even if we had fully conservative government we would get some oversight now its not some magic pill other countries have gridlock and all kinds of bs even without first past the post but this binary teamism is really antithetical to healthy republic in fact trump proves its down right dangerous	0
yeah pretty much because he is republican its extreme teamism in the south you vote republican because that is your team you can disagree with every word and policy but its your team its like being mega fan of losing sports team you can hate all their trades and the coach but your glued to the tv every game its not big deal when its entertainment when its something life changing like politics its kinda insane but its how things are down here in the south	0
the good news is most young republicans under believe in agw the bad news is they are as infected with teamism as the rest and will vote gop even if the guy running says he wants to pollute the planet more	0

there no footage or photographic evidence of people being taken into or dragged out of gas chambers there weren even million jews in nazi controlled territory at the time and if there were it would take years to cremate millions bodies simple investigation or visit to auschwitz can prove it david cole did that in the he jew how many great researchers have also exposed it and paid heavy price david irving robert faurisson ernst ndel victor thorn etc the leuchter report fred arthur leuchter jr is jew is scientifically sound document and for many the final word on the feasibility of mass homicidal gassings at nazi camps there were no gas chambers intended for mass executions and not single jew was gassed it ludicrous to think that those facilities were technically equipped for gassing or cremation on an industrial scale especially considering the fossil fuel shortage germany was experiencing towards the end of the war it fact admitted by auschwitz authorities that their gas chamber was built by the polish after the war for propaganda purposes there also no documented evidence of hitler executive order targeting jews for extermination the final solution hitler simply wanted germany free of jews after their treachery of ww and the subsequent treaty of versailles hitler lifted the german economy in years by stopping the jewish banking scheme of printing counterfeit money and charging interest on it the red cross was present in all camps and reported on their conditions regularly no evidence of genocide according to the jewish world almanac the world population of jews increased between and from to winston churchill never mentioned the holocaust in his book the second world war of auschwitz authorities changed the plaque from million to one million and half in the are we supposed to still swallow the million number what happened to million jews and why did jews make it illegal to question investigate and deny the holocaust in some countries in november of after being found guilty of questioning the official story year old ursula haverbeck was sentenced to ten months in prison in germany they want to pass the same laws in america what are they afraid of truth doesn fear investigation about jews died during ww in work camps not death camps mostly of starvation and typhus the million number has been used as propaganda by zionists since at least watch dda- q_xuhk general patton felt we fought for the wrong side in letter to his wife of september chief rabbi arye friedman jew in the vienna suddeutsche zeitung on dec wrote on page the holocaust is successful historical fiction	0
removed the previous post as should have written charged each year not jailed and it in the thousands not hundreds charge will lead to lost jobs and social ostracism etc and in some extreme cases violent attacks on the person charged the latest high profile case involves an year old woman ursula haverbeck sentenced to months in jail and her defence lawyer also sentenced to prison for defending her	0

tell me ve never been able to extract an answer about this from high-level holocaust revisionist if auschwitz or dachau and the rest were really just labor camps as suggested by most deniers including ursula haverbeck for example what were all the jewish children elderly and infirm which nobody disputes were indeed removed from the general population and sent there be doing in those camps the nazi even went so far as to question monasteries and orphanages if any of the babies or children were jewish so they could be taken away as testified by countless priests nuns recorded in churches papers etc and they did this all over europe	0

what follows here is like vogon poetry with robust splatters playing the part of the vogon guard resistance is useless notice that trolls have stopped making their profiles private probably because it too much of giveaway	0
it what big centralized government and the vogon bureaucrats do to keep people stupid	0

former bernie supporter pretty much the whole thread consolidates that there is not much difference between trump supporters and bernie supporters some take the stance that bernie changed his mind between and now based on circumstance he feels different way others pretend that the full context makes difference anything just to be berniecrat bernie probably still believes medicaid for all would bankrupt the nation it would he is not trying to sell medicaid for all he trying to sell medicare for all wait for the cbo score nobody should be bernicrat or any other crat you should be trying to listen to and digest facts not trying to justify any amp everything just because of who says it	1
in order for there to be bernicrat sanders would have to have been democrat and not just use the democratic party for its infrastructure as he himself openly admitted he not they re not	1
dont feel bad about being bernicrat either because so many hillary supporters told us as they continue to do now that they dont want progressives in the democratic party	1

gt you can be bernicrat in california or massachusetts and good for you you can be that and win in florida or texas or wisconsin or ohio	1
there another anecdote point to there are probably major subs on reddit dedicated to bernicrat takeover of the democratic party most of them are heavily brigaded by our friends over at t_d they basically function as an extension of hillaryforprison the mods allow them to be manipulated by trump people it benefits trump and the republicans to feed the fire of this insurgency in the democratic party	1
the ideological purity test of the bernicrat movement needs to go drown in lake our lord and savior bernie sands can be has been and is wrong bernie way is not the only way and it is possible to achieve his goals without throwing all expert economic advice out the window and hoping that everything is sunshine and rainbows	1
you can be bernicrat in california or massachusetts and good for you you can be that and win in florida or texas or wisconsin or ohio	1
now am bernicrat	1
and then bernie sanders takes the nomination this will be the greatest karmic backlash of all time it will also prove that if you keep true to your beliefs in politics you will come out on top and set new political class bernicrat	1
not to mention that in the blanket primary the incumbent republican won and the bernicrat guy won so if you want to call that win ok	1
that is why the democrats need to stop running shitty ossof generic democrats and start running more populist leaning pro worker pro people democrats was progressive through and through bernicrat no but he to the left of center which is way more than many in the democratic party	1
whereas the bernicrat our revolution group won new seat	1
gt to watch so many of the bernicrat camp practically rend their hair lamenting if only joe had run	1
it been both sad and funny to watch so many of the bernicrat camp practically rend their hair lamenting if only joe had run	1
the establishment democrats don really like her type they threw ton of money away in an attempt to beat her in the primary and she identifies as bernicrat which doesn go over well with them either everyone is aware of how the dnc fucked sanders over	1
your friendly neighborhood bernicrat	1
didn say supporting sanders publicly means losing losing candidate but there lot of evidence that when bernie himself publicly supports candidate or even ballot measure that they more often than not lose and from what ve seen the candidates that have been personally endorsed by bernie they lose like of the time and endorsements by my revolution don mean much to me because how much time effort and money do they contribute when tea party candidates run everyone knows they re tea partier they don hide it but pellegrino didn really advertise being bernicrat or our revolution much did she	1
do the same but bernie is not that old person any centrist democrat has basically all the same policy but has way better rhetoric and doesn falsely play victim vote for bernicrat over republican but never vote for them over competent non-populist democrat we need to humanize each other more in this country not voting for someone who dehumanizes half of their own party	1
they don need perfect leaders just common enemy liberals can even decide who the opposition really is first and foremost there lot more in-fighting at least as it allowed to be seen publicly many progressive liberals are as mad at moderate establishment liberals as they are at the far right and many moderate liberals are as upset at bernicrat millennial socialist liberals as they are at the far right the quest for perfection has gotten in the way of progress	1
gt the ideological purity test of the bernicrat movement needs to go drown in lake	1
no then we ll pull all of the knives out of the backs of cruz rubio and the rest and put them all in jebs back if he the only one left jebya will not win the general election why would he	0

wrong push shove hold my dog ransom will not vote for jebya not this time around if america is going to crash and burn then get it over with quickly with hillary and hit the reset	0
don know what trump said about isis few months ago but sure as hell remember your brother george bush saying that he looked putin in the eye as he shook hands with him and saw good man honorable man murderous ex-kgb leader good man fu jebya your brother gw bush didn even bomb the saudis where most of the hijackers came from with their backing	0
guess your idea of research consists of endorsements that candidate gets don give flying about what some scumbag lobbyists think about candidate that just proves that he is being targetted by bribe money rand paul is mitch mcconnells puppet will write in cruz name before vote for paul jebya walker christie trump or any of the other phonies with the possible exception of bobby jindal don trust potheads	0
shhhhh just applied for that position ll be millionaire by next year if hired bet can waste money faster than his old campaign finance director got my eye on some each jebya yard signs	0
so jeb bush just endorsed trump hey jebya we the people have lot of really cool things we could be doing if you politicians woulld leave us alone and stop picking our pockets just stfu and go away if campaigning for potus is beneath your dignity it certainly isn such bother to the other candidates except your girlfriend hillary	0
rubio jebya with coke habit	0
trump is the republican only ticket to winning or chance at getting close this time around jebya canada cuba cruz baby face rubio don look up the word santorum on the internet krisp krispy and ayn rand paul will get decimated no matter who the democratic nominee is that fact	0
honestly if jebya wants to take out these other clowns ok with that let the rinos go extinct	0
jebya is weak	0
oh jebya you poor little entitled neocon	0
jebya forgot yo add that qualifier compassionate to conservative that illegals rape and murder is an act of love or compassion for the american people	0
of americans believe obama is muslim rightfully so most of those are probably republicans since dems are so lo info so jebya just told wide swath of his base that what they believe is lie way to win over your base dummy	0
jebya is leading just start reading the poll ranking list from the bottom up	0
jebya doneya	0
would want cruz you could vote for walker jebya whoever will write in cruz name before vote for rino answer your question walker will go the way of romney stop looking at the polls regarding walker in the general election he will melt into pool of blubbering incoherent doublespeak under the assault of the dems look at his stumbling now in low stress situation not presidential material good gov for blue wisconsin stay there	0
not much better than jebya we can afford to waste time on proven phonies like walker last time around it was like the flavor of the week with herman cain newt santorum until we were left with the rino romney this time there are so many wannabes we conservatives have to send the gope type packing sooner rather than later walker used up all his get out of jail free cards already get out of the way cruz and jindal are viable conservatives imo	0
agree except on the preferred establishment candidate part think jebya is their with walker as the back-up plan candidate	0
walker is the gop establishment back-up for jebya	0
his whole message includes bringing the whole third world into america as an act of love and compassion rather than fix their sh thole countries sounds like jeb bush you gonna vote for jebya	0
per orders from on high direct from rupert murdoch on pain of firing confirmed by foxnews insiders support and promote only establishment repubs especially jebya and walker or resign	0
right now the fat cats are trying to decide if they wanna risk it with rube-io or jebya	0
the woman behind jebya has the correct reaction belly laugh and finger point	0
maybe jebya could promise to give them ours	0
next jebya will be speaking farsi on al jazeera to get the islamist terrorist vote	0
too bad jebya doesn believe mexico strict immigration policy would be good for america	0
so jebya are you equating yourself to dear old dad bush read my lips no new taxes so can we assume that you plan to follow in dad footsteps and be backstabbing rino the answer is resounding yesssssssssss	0
isn it amazing how the bushes stick to their principles like glue when it really matters to them and not the american citizens jebya and dubya push forward on illegal amnesty come hell or high water but on taxes or smaller less intrusive government well now is not the time for that fight it too divisive	0
they certainly won vote for your stick in the mud guy jebya bush	0
not according to the front runner jebya he finally abandoned disowned your line of thought	0
does jebya even know why he wants to be president mean what exactly is his plan just gwb part deaux wide open borders endless spending and dumbing down the school kids even further yeah ll vote for that not	0
there will be nothing left for hillary to wreck in just things to fix jebya will fix it the same way as hillary will that is of course if there even is an election in	0
rubio numbers thought were slowly rising since jebya is falling further out of favor with the establishment maybe it just the polls that ve seen but the numbers seem to be wildly different from poll to poll also you have to differentiate between the individual state polls and the national polls in addition to all voters vs just republican primary voters	0
if you google and read local wisconsin press articles you ll find that walker was not friend to the grassroots teaparty conservatives in the wisconsin legislature he dragged his feet on fighting common core for years and even undercut the legislatuere efforts until very recently same with amnesty walker has been and is rino yeah he fought the unions and won but can trust him he may be great gov for blue wisconsin but don see him as presidential there are too many conservative pretenders running in the primary as it is just sucking up oxygen and attention from possible true conservative candidates like cruz or possibly jindal walker needs to get off the field along with others like christie jebya rand paul	0
to coulter jebya is the only one running who can win only because her hero romney isn running again	0
hey jebya waaaaaaassssssssup what your new e-mail address have couple of choice questions for you to answer and not by your spokesidiot	0
jeb bush would never win as an independent in three way race trump or cruz would still get more republican votes and very few dems would vote for bush why would they cross over to jebya in that scenario see hillary winning with something like of the vote	0
bingo just ploy by the establishment gop to throw the election to jebya or hillary it wouldn matter to democrat contributor trump	0
kiss of death jebya romulan grahamnesty see they understand that cruz is fake	0
seems as if you are referring to when jebya stole the election for dubya	0
the bush family will rig it for jebya count on it they ll either keep trump off the ballot where they can throw his votes out where machines are involved and do their best to stop trump voters before they even get to the polls as ve been warning everyone on this site trump hasn seen anything yet when it comes to the bush crime syndicate don think for second they won throw trumps votes out for jebya just like jebya did for dubya in florida face it folks trump is out to expose the republican party for what it is but its gonna start to get real difficult for him now he better ask obama for secret service protection wouldn put anything past the cross-eyed inbred bush junta	0
he ain listening nor does he care as some have pointed out the chamber of commerce wants all the cheap illegal labor something both bernie and don have pointed out wanna bet jebya is gonna get the nomination rigged for himself wanna bet ballots will suddenly disappear as they did in in florida if trump gets close	0
did jebya actually speak to la raza	0
if you hate obama you are gonna love jebya believe me is lightyears worse than anything obama has ever said or done	0
jebya is wasting his time there is only one candidate we want and only one candidate who can take us to the promised land and that man is not you trump	0
so the fake mexican jebya is going to win the republican nomination with illegal hispanic votes and the hispanic rubio is going to win with the black lives matter black thug vote and these are republicans	0
agree with you your original post said any republican candidate not any establishment republican candidate not picking nits with you as you and are on the same page it world of difference between cruz and the gope candidates like jebya evolving walker rand paul the mcconnell buttboy christie the unfunny bad fat joke etc speaking of christie where has fatboy been lately	0
you do realize that gov walker is gope backed by the us chamber of commerce right think you will come around in time like did and see walker as back-up for jebya by the establishment just pay close attention to walkers evolving positions and statements like this anti-amnesty after the fact statement where the hell was walker the last two months when it might have mattered and not be seen as opportunistic walker is leading from behind	0
remember jebya is the dumb bush he gets his words mixed up he meant to say liberal blood flowing through his veins and it blue	0
you are mentally retarded mulatto pedophile think you are talking about jebya dubya and the bush nazi gestapo junta syndicate there are more southern baptist evangelical pastors who are child molesters and add in the conservative catholic bishops and priests who are molesters and pedophiles and this is the bunch trump is going after wake up buddy sounds like you are racist and and uneducated prick	0
sorry won happen for all the reasons you dislike jebya besides being shrub is the exact reason he will not just go away you see in his mind besides being legend he knows that you and are but simpleton bumpkins too stupid to govern ourselves according to his openly gay campaign mgr miller so jebya needs months to splain to us rubes how brilliant he is and how profoundly stupid we are for not seeing it but he willing to sacrifice his time to save us serfs can you say delusions of grandeur perfect specimen of pompous arrogant slimy fool and he doesn even see it but almost everyone else sees it it really hard to miss	0
walker proamnesty pro-common core do some research he gope back-up for jebya research and verify it doesn hurt	0
it may be possible for the establishment republican machine and huge big donor money will jam jebya down our throats in the repub primary however the violent projectile vomit will occur in the general election with massive number massive number of conservatives either sitting out the election or writing in name myself and every single one of my friends feel this way and we are rock solid in our conviction to this no more beg me bribe me cajole me threaten me the answer is no hellllll noooo to jeb bush or any rino will not vote for jeb bush and not single one of my family or friends will either got that karl rove grover norquist and the rest of you scumbags	0
was that sat nite live skit witnessed at cpac starring jebya and hannity wow just wow	0
cpac invited him for comic relief jebya actually went thinking he is so friggin brilliant he was actually going to convert the views of conservatives to his enlightened repub philosophy ooops didn work because he is not smart but an inept buffoon lol	0
can you say d-o-r-k-y when first saw that picture almost busted gut like white obama you do realize that that particular video freezeframe was puposely selected by breitbart right jebya obviously isn their guy either lol	0
oh no no no jebya would be batman robin	0
jebya was too dumb to even getting away with stacking the deck in the cpac straw poll lol lol bussed in teenie groupie cheerleaders hahahaha can make this stuff up like sat nite live skit lol lol	0
just substitute obama for jebya in your statement scarry	0
no think its simpler than that jebya is such spoiled arrogant pompous power mad egomaniac fratboy so out of touch with everything he believes that he can and will win literally he is legend in his own mind	0
agree totally jebya is dead candidate walking very strangely might add	0
even the mom flip-flops first she was against jebya running for potus then she was for it you can make this stuff up	0
marco and jebya belongs to the same category	0
marco and jebya belongs to the same category	0
you just named four top cuckservatives that the new term coined for limp wristed establishment republicans that enjoy watching conservatives in their own party get cked and letting the dems do the same ve read that it really pisses off the gope just in case you didn know it contraction of the words cuckold and conservative if it pisses off people like karl rove and jebya ll use it more often	0
rove cheney rumsfeld ashcroft the scum of the repugnant party took up where ronnie left off in ruining the us economy and social safety net and preventing citizens from opposing it followed by hysteria and the patriot acts removed basic civil rights such as habeas corpus protection against search and seizure of personal property spying on us citizens etc in other words the replacement of democracy with fascist plutocracy they succeeded and now the us has to claw back the basic rights it signed away after cruz cotton paul walker perry fiorina jindal trump jebya they all have the same agenda they are cynical pretending to patriotism that is meaningless and openly urging the total abandonment of the us constitution in other words they are out to destroy what is left of america and pocket the profits the kochs are the banksters rove and cheney are the puppet-masters the rest are puppets and clownsticks	0
does jeb bush make your legs tingle jeb is total pos candidate why can you get moderate candidate that wins the general election dole fail mccain fail romney fail jeb bush fail see pattern sparky why don you support cruz we held our noses enough for your stinky loser moderate candidates in the past you want to see million repubs sit home in just try and jam jebya down our throats	0
so go vote for some loser rino jebya christie walker	0
liked walker when he was kicking the unions butts in wisconsin and left it at that about months ago with just minutes of googling got nasty wake up call on what walker was really all about rino gope trash never looked back convinced that walker is the establishment repubs back-up candidate to jebya sorry for the dupe post bb doesn like word used it hurt their ears	0
probably both walker created state bureaucracy and expected it to run efficiently and honestly he set it up and left it on autopilot shows his lack of leadership and accountability skills even on small scale and yet the wizards of smart tell us we need governor jebya in order to have valuable executive experience even could review these numbers and have thrown bunch of crooks in jail and recovered that money for the taxpayers	0
an act of love according to jebya	0
back in the day he used to be republican establishment type now he full fledged rino in the same league as jebya chris christie mccain mcconnell boehner just run of the mill back stabbing traitor	0
cruz prayed for hours with his family on whether to run or not win or lose he on mission he solid the media onslaught will be relentless be sure of that they only can exert so much force it would be just as intense against jebya or walker in the general the problem for cruz is that he will be fighting the gope in addition just like the man voted for month after my th b-day ronald wilson reagan in nov of keep the faith it can happen again	0
yeah see that too walker is the back-up establishment candidate to jebya	0
dem will leak it just before the election as opposition research hillary camp probably already has it and so does jebya why would they not	0
oh please don misunderstand conservative and despise all of the pretenders paul christie jebya fiorina trump like cruz and am looking presently at bobby jindal the forgotten candidate more closely walker is good guy but is his own worst enemy he should just say what in his heart good bad or indifferent he would come across as being much more genuine instead of this sad muddled consultant polled image he trying to pull off	0
jebya would be much happier with front row seat at the golden corral	0
jebya bush is no more cerebral than marco rubio is charismatic	0
just more evidence of the dumming down of the republican party caused in large part by fatal brain ailment known as trumpitis the stupid it burns	0
they have trumpitis	0
hundreds of democrats know are voting trump its pandemic called trumpitis	0
seems like you have come down with bad case of trumpitis it is brain disorder cured only by ted cruz nomination	0
can help it ve caught trumpitis just have to keep winning and winning lol	0
hear trumpitis is going around	0
trumpitis is deadly with no known cure	0
hope this doesn mean she will be struck with trumpitis there is enough of that going on at fox already can barely watch most of them anymore except her	0
really sarcasm is generally funny what you said was rather pathetic so are you going to be an observer or was that sarcasm as well trumpitis appears to be catching	0
you are correct do have trumpitis and damn proud of it trump	0
clearly you are suffering from trumpitis not to worry it can be cured please see dr levin when you have moment	0
poor megyn she came down with bad case of trumpitis it is an inflammation of the ego that causes insecurity envy and depression in light weight journalists the only cure is to face the truth your career is over take hike dragon lady no one cares what you think anymore	0
that might be trumpitis	0
cruz has trumpitis sinking feeling in the stomach followed by depression	0
he does not feel well that right he suffering from trumpitis it tends to make you feel like you got your ass kicked	0
he got case of trumpitis	0
people should read it can happen here by sinclair lewis written during the great depression the book examines the rise of totalitarianism in the us using quasi fiction to deal with huey long democracies and republican governments only work in times of relative stability they can tolerate wars clearly and economic crises to an extent but when critical mass of people feel disenfranchised left out economically they will seek radical solutions mix that with lack of education and you have mess from that mire will rise dictator trump is like mold it only grows when the conditions are right dry the air out let some air in and it will go away educate people give them viable voice and the trumpitis many have caught will disappear	0

this makes perfect sense actually the democratic party has for several decades been big tent party with bunch of single issue constituencies within it br br the gay community economic policy preferences swing bit to the right so with gay rights apparently settled issue the left might no longer capture that vote the aca was bob dole health plan so it had broad appeal- now that it settled legal issue the left might lose that constituency br br on economic policy the gop has been pushing non-sensical pro-cyclical fiscal policy for years now unfortunately the obama administration didn create much of distinction between themselves and the gop on this issue the fed unprecedented monetary policy allowed the administration to get away with contractionary fiscal policy during recession hopefully we ll find the gop to follow their historic pattern of campaigning as hayekians governing keynesians but who knows br br the kicker though might be that military intervention in the middle east is however not settled issue and the gop might succeed in driving away voters by too eagerly espousing interventionism this certainly scared away would be clinton and mccain voters in	0
dr krugman and readers to stimulate the us economy out of recession symmetrical combination of complementary monetary and fiscal policies has delivered historically in his recent memoir the courage to act memoir of crisis and its aftermath dr ben bernanke the immediate former fed chair states br often said that monetary policy was not panacea-- we needed congress to do its part and he continues after the crisis calmed that help was not forthcoming so if indeed political agitprop surrounds recent discussions of the federal debt issue economically this charade has been very costly by having to rely asymmetrically on very accommodating monetary policy without coordinated stimulative fiscal policy but contractionary one instead the recovery from the great recession was both diminished and slowed as result production and employment significantly trailed their production-possibilities frontiers and this potential production is lost forever as is the depreciation of employees workplace skills due to this forgone production the investment asset base upon which future economic rois depend as well as wage gains via increased worker productivity is also diminished by the economy operating well within its production-possibilities frontier instead of on it during and after the great recession thus agitprop is economically very costly friday greenville nc	0
not word about the troika demanding to decide for the greek government exactly where to cut expenses cut pensions contractionary do not increase taxes must no upset the job creators do not cut on defence must not upset the arms exporters br br yes too think some in europe want now the greek economy to scream	0
professor krugman br br certainly understand that you know lot more about international trade than most but have to disagree with you on this one br br going back to the standard textbooks yours among others an increase in tariffs by country will reduce imports but stimulate domestic production in import competing industries if country responds by doing the same then country exports also fall neither country benefits as much as they could from specialisation thus their full employment level of output falls this would show up as fall in the level of gdp and thus would be contractionary br br so what romney saying is not that far off perhaps you would argue that recessions come from the demand side shift in ad and are short run but otherwise the mechanism have outlined from your book jives with the spirit of what he is saying br br calling this and that wash comes across as handwsving on your part could you clarify in subsequent post	0
this is an unusually disappointing article from adam davidson as he well knows the fed can and does do much more than set the overnight rate two humongous examples during world war ii it kept interest rates down to facilitate large bond sales by the treasury to finance the war shift to the present for the last several years it has acted in similar way expanding the money supply enormously to fend off depression and ameliorate what now known as the great recession in this latter role some say that it did the best it could to reverse the effects of the counter-productive fiscal conservatism of the congress which was enacting contractionary policy at the obviously wrong time others say that it was creating an ocean of liquidity that eventually will cause another bubble it might even turn out that both are true my point here is that the fed open market actions buying or selling treasury bonds also has huge effect on america and the world economy	0
if there is governance problem in this policy process it lies in congress not the fed in crisis the country needs monetary policy and fiscal policy to work together to help the economy move forward the fed controls monetary policy and has done about all it can do to support the economy congress controls fiscal policy and has blocked all efforts to stimulate demand and has thus had its feet on the brakes br br this article claims that having some kind of superior accountability mechanism would have allowed the fed to do the impossible first to predict crisis no one predicted and second to better manage interest rates at the zero lower bound with no fiscal policy support br br our continuing issues with gdp growth employment and wage growth are not due to poor governance at the fed they are due to lack of fiscal policy support from congress austerity is contractionary that the problem the fact that we cannot pinpoint the individual at the fed who did not predict what was unpredictable is not the problem	0
mr draghi is perhaps the shrewdest player in this bureaucratic poker game he deftly fought back german opposition to his sweeping stimulus plan forging alliances with the many countries in europe who feared continued stagnation br br if only his plan was actually stimulus plan the reality is that lowering rates below about is actually tight repressive contractionary and deflationary policy so all he has managed to do is make things much much worse	0
it seems to me that interest on reserves and consolidation in banking might play role here in the near term more interest on reserves will probably translate into pure profits in real terms those profits will be larger the more contractionary the rate rise turns out to be right	0

jews can even comprehend the idea of any other ethnic group having their own interests there are few here or there maybe michael savage or paul gottfried who get it but it extremely rare jews don feel safe unless they live is cosmopolitan and multicultural society as whites we are too individualistic and far less racist and judgemental than other groups contrary to the claims of leftist academia especially tribalistic middle eastern peoples that why we see jews dominating in the west and not in say japan or saudi arabia it why our societies are more liberal tried to support zionism for years in the hope that jews could get it but it futile because they never do and will likely never hold up their promise to support nationalism for us so screw it could care less what happens to them at this point	0

nations are returning to their tribalistic heritages post-christian world they just fail to understand how brutal and short life is within tribalistic context	0
do you think muslim what strange conclusion to come to but one which betrays your tribalistic mindset am simply pointing out the relationship between cause and effect if the british people don want to see that and persist in in the idea that these foreigners are willing to risk theirs and their family lives just so they can go to the uk to sponge off the system then you will continue to create these situations in the future and presumably react with confusion when masses of people arrive on their doorsteps actions have consequences it very simple you have the choice between self-righteous outrage or seeing the world for how it actually works and maybe improving the lives of the people of britain and those of the people of these countries	0

just as your response is based on gut feel so is mine believe that islam is considered above loyalty to country by most islamist would say would put islam over the too know gentle muslims but my thought is they would put their community first as we have seen in brussels think there is point where either voluntary or pressed cohesion will take place believe lot of it will be driven from within but unfortunately also from hatred fear from the outside don know what the percentage will be but believe there is point where the cultures will clash hard believe bringing more muslims into the country definitely increases the likelihood of more terrorist attacks as it increases the pool of candidates for radicalization basically the difference think is that some simply see islamist as just another insert oppressed group and that if we are just nice to them then the terrorism will stop see them as group possibly under the control of few with very tribalistic traits that cannot be assimilated away	0

you are most certainly free to hold whatever opinion you would like however will point out here that saying things you don like doesn make one bigot you cannot martial much if any evidence that ct actually hates jews blacks women or young people hatred of small dogs is universal however so will give you that one dislike of the blm movement is not hatred of black people it dislike of that specific movement ll be honest don like them either and for good reason they re routinely dishonest never wait for facts claim they re being discriminated against as group while they push exactly the same type of discrimination and have tendency to attract violent thugs and thereby start riots or at least start small scale violence directed at the very same le that are protecting them from the potential of violent counter-protests also disapprove of their tactics such as shutting down highways and disapprove of their violent rhetoric no justice no peace isn slogan it thinly veiled threat to riot if they don get their way pigs in blanket fry em like bacon is an even less thinly veiled threat to start killing police officers simply for being police officers such statements are reckless intentionally inflammatory and quite frankly rather disgusting they are however legal no one is responsible for the shooting in dallas other than the guy who pulled the trigger he owns that one does any of this make blm terrorist organization no the same way shooting of an abortion doctor here or there doesn make the family research council terrorist organization what the facts make blm is group of unpleasant hypocritical liars with mild streak of lawlessness and some violent fringe members that is pushing an agenda based on the illusion of systemic racism and tribalistic penchant most people have to defend members of their own perceived group in knee-jerk way because they perceive an attack on the group to be personal in short they re obnoxious reckless agitators that are harming both community police relations and race relations in this country that what blm is so would certainly agree with you that certain judgement has vastly overstated the situation and that the facts do not back up his her assertion here however going bit over the top on subject that inflames the passions of many people does not make him her bigot emotions over this issue are running hot with lot of people throwing around even more charged language is unnecessary and unwise	0

the hilarious thing is you you are completely blind to the nonsense positions you are defending all because you are tribalistic and react with emotion rather than reason the democrats always use emotion in their propaganda and this works on you because you are not smart enough to engage your brain instead of your emotions notice how the neo-marxist big state democrats always make appeals on emotional terms that because history logic reason evidence economics and family morality are all against their positions but they manage to fool you every time so it is hilarious to hear you defend the creeping big state fascism and power grabs of your appointed masters everyone can see you have no new arguments and the ones you do put up are easily shot down for the nonsense propaganda talking-points they are did you not notice the other guests to this thread have been modding me up and bypassing the drivel your masters have fed you although unlike you fascists of the left we don need to censor opposing points of view or try drown them with shouting because our positions are the rational ones that work and are supported by evidence you have no new arguments and your positions have all been demonstrated as not only wrong and not only impossible to make work as tried in dozens of countries over the last century but you dimocrats are not too bright and don learn too well from history not that you know much but are harmful to societies families and liberty even after your failed ideology has slaughtered million innocent people you collectivists still want to impose your will and try one more time to turn the free world into your north korean socialist utopia right now you are displaying classic leftist pidgeon behavior do you know what that is mon all your arguments have been shredded do you have any positions to debate or are you just another lame windbag with ad hominems and nothing else bet you don even understand that the socialism of the left is immoral because it is involuntary whereas the charity of the right is not only moral because it is voluntary it is also times more efficient because it doesn incur the overhead of creating state bureaucracies to administer badly oh they didn tell you and you weren smart enough to work it out socialism is all about growing the state and creating more and bigger bureaucracies that stifle freedom and steal money from hard working taxpayers all because you narcissists of the left wants to feel good about yourself by forcing your sanctimony on everyone else what good little slave you are	0

like said the current illegal immigrants are very different case from larry thorne doubt there are many foreign bona fide war heroes among the current immigrants let alone ones who share the western values to start with just telling his story for reasons he was hero whose story deserves to be remembered by the younger generations and also to bring new facts into the discussion larry thorne was an illegal immigrant who was given legal status through his military service he proves that in some rare cases letting illegals into us armed forces can be the right choice but he had something to contribute he had compatible values and he was in essence fleeing from communism he had expertise and experience with winter warfare and fighting against soviet russians skills which americans sorely lacked that why they were happy to get finnish officers into their army finns are predominantly evangelic lutheran which is protestant christian church and thus compatible with the protestant us heritagd our main values are working hard being honest and being fiercely independent that very different from the collectivistic and tribalistic mindset of many recent immigrants he wasn in essence an economic migrant like many of the current illegals he just couldn be sure that his life was safe in europe from the soviet russians he had built himself quite reputation fighting the russians who were the enemy of the usa also it bit of the same thing as if somebody with proven record of fighting against radical islamic terrorism came in illegally after the situation got too dangerous for them to continue their fight closer to home problem is the countries where the fight is now going on there are no such reliable records and identity documentation kept about people that there was sufficient proof of the immigrant being the real mccoy finnish army on the other hand was able to provide the americans with the military records of larry thorne so there were no such ambiguities in the vetting process in his case as there would be nowadays with current illegal immigrants his case was very special and in many ways not at all comparable with the current illegals but it was story worth telling anyway he was not only finnish hero but an american hero as well	0

this is interesting the vast majority of black americans will be competing with the illegal population in general one many of the illegal populations are living in the same inner city areas as the black americans hence increased competition for employment between the race groups two both groups will be vying for the entitlement dollars but those will be greatly shrinking from low or under employment in all brackets declining populations in general and low to under educated groups of employable thirdly given the nature of black america to be less cohesive as race even to the point of being tribalistic see the black lives matter for this or any protest in recent years or the attitudes expressed when black america gains prominent positions and moves out of the ghetto or is conservative or speaks out on problems in the community the cohesion needed to advance the whole becomes shredded for the convenience of few black america will be at greater risk of failure from the lack of purposeful cohesiveness to advance their overall position in society given all of this loretta lynch is shredder rather than looking at the encompassing picture of her race within the united states and how her comments will manifest greater decline of the black population by putting forth more obstacles in their path	0

approached the podium cnn broke away from its trump is bad guy interviews to cover his speech they covered the first minutes and then broke away to the same news stories they had been running in the segment prior to trump speech why did cnn suddenly break away from trump they did so because he was educating the audience about the evils of free trade agreements and any outlet owned by ted turner cannot have the ignorant learning about what free trade agreements have done to our country what cnn did is representative of renewed attack upon donald trump in an attempt to recruit low iq voters to abandon trump and support clinton trump wants to send blacks back to africa black lives matter supporter located at donald trump rally in atlanta protester made the absurd comment trump wants to ship black people back to africa he also stated that trump wife is an illegal immigrant because she is from europe implying that all european people are in america illegally if trump truly wanted to ship

iraq on map over of all americans cannot name the current vice-president gee is that all trump fault too stupid people will believe these ridiculous messages being perpetrated by george soros and the mainstream media now it is true that most of these targeted morons will not vote but enough will to swing an election the method used to deliver the propaganda where have we heard the following statement tell big enough lie often enough the masses will come to believe it psychologists refer to this process as confirmation bias confirmation bias works because the research shows that if people are exposed to the same message often enough whether true of untrue people will believe the statement as fact the ignorant are especially vulnerable to the use of confirmation bias because stupid people have little information from which to do fact any meaningful fact checking on the propaganda that they are being fed the answer the only surefire way to counteract this media bias and moronic grass roots attacks upon trump is to do the same thing to hillary clinton in reverse and do so in greater volume therefore it is incumbent that all trump supporters get into the bash hillary movement democrats bunch of rich people convincing poor people to vote for the rich people by telling the poor people that other rich people are the reason they re poor jon always remember the only difference between genius and stupidity is that genius has its limits anonymous you re welcome slave vote trump in	0
why don you take that huge out of your mouth trumpshitter so that we can finally understand that bulls it flowing out of it this one for you shole criticisms of trump rebuked he doesn like hispanics women fill in the blank the attempt to portray trump as racist or misogynist fails on its face it is slander leveled by people who know he is likely to fare better with latinos in november than mitt romney did in percent love to send this year entire seventeen-strong gop field through the streets of south brooklyn precisely one would get waves of appreciative welcome and it not either of our candidates who were actual hispanics as for women any republican faces challenge in the current era of government as master nurturer but strong self-reliant women are pervasive among trump supporters and there is not whiff of mistreatment of women in his business history quite the opposite trump world appears to be complete meritocracy where women and people of color are rewarded for performance without regard to race or gender this is admittedly jarring in country that has been led too long by democrats obsessed with weaponizing both he seeks evangelical support but has hardly led biblical life direct hit and to many it appears not to matter one shred maybe it because every honest christian who has traveled redemptive path will tell you that god is not interested in your missteps he is interested in your next steps rehashing trump multiple marriages and long-ago boasts okay most were long ago are as irrelevant as litany of any sinner past as long as the current path seems solid there is no evidence that he carries the stain of current violations of any major commandment and while two corinthians may reveal less than pastorly bible literacy many pastors back him why because while the gop field boasted many actual evangelicals with devout biographies none seems to carry the potential to do what christianity needs most urgently right now blast through the suffocating political correctness that seeks to strangle our religious freedoms every day congress might be your voice but they don represent you or where is the wall notice they passed legislation authorizing the building of wall and then silent as the fog rolling in they refused to appropriate any money to build it people who see nothing wrong with an invasion of your country by millions of aliens are not your friends and likely aren even your people whether or not want my congressthing to have any influence depends on what he intends to do with it to paraphrase heine god you made the beautiful blue sky the lovely green meadows the stately trees so god could you possibly decorate these trees with my enemies conservatives are funny lot they persuade and coax and convince and lure people to their side and when they pivot to agreement with us they then kick them in the crotch for not being with them in the first place their entire lives we can count on his supreme court nominees what do people want him to do he gave us fat list of wonderful constitutionalist judges who would honorably fill the shoes of antonin scalia do we need joint news conference with one of those names so that skeptics can know he means it that is wildly inappropriate before he even accepts the nomination and best left to the first days of his presidency when he can make that announcement surrounded by the compelling imagery of the white house trump tormentors responded to his worthy list with the same taunt they roll out with every conservative promise he makes you can believe him he total liar this is the mantra of those who don just doubt him they hate him he does stunningly unpresidential things yes he does and most of them have helped him win the nomination to the chagrin of more mannerly tastes his admittedly brash and aggressive style has been punctuated with moments of truly embarrassing excess those moments have dwindled as he has sent his rivals home his discipline should sharpen even further now that he has but one opponent to target and those attacks on hillary clinton will delight rather than annoy millions of republicans who have watched him flay their favored hopeful he contributed to democrats no kidding as does every businessman who wants to curry favor across party lines daresay trump would not open checkbook for her these days now that their relationship is political this trope is trundled out by critics seeking to sow seeds of doubt as to trump reliability on core values he doesn have any core values have you listened to the man here are ten off the bat stronger borders blasting political correctness leveling the trade playing field rebuilding the military taking better care of veterans protecting gun rights creating jobs speaking truth to global jihad and the broadly stated but resonant make america great again anyone is free to agree or disagree with those but they have been recurring themes every day of his campaign doubters may claim that he might not follow through on all ten but ll bet his batting average with those stated goals is better than the sorry job the republican establishment has done following through on all of those things they said they would do if only we won the house if only we won the senate if only if only he has stated often that he may adjust views as he becomes more familiar with various issues while this annoys ideologues like me it may prove somewhat endearing to voters who sense he may listen as he learns the ropes of governance and on things like reticence to commit troops to the middle east am hoping he adjusts that view right after his first security briefing the afternoon of january he compliments putin he sure does in certain oblique way noting the russian leader strength and devotion to his goals for his part putin is eating it up to the degree that he has thrown compliment or two back trump way this is not exactly mister gorbachev tear down this wall but what it may be is master deal-maker softening an adversary in preparation for global chess match that might go better with an opening chapter of sweet-talk than it has of late with obama empty rhetoric followed by inaction or worse it is true that trump has zero experience dealing with foreign leaders but he has half-century of experience sizing up rivals and adversaries using words and actions to lure them toward his agenda he traffics in conspiracy theories this wholly accurate trump criticism holds water but dings him far less than those wielding it might wish his flirtations with such matters has ranged from the goofy rafael cruz and lee harvey oswald to the inexcusable bush lied about wmds to get us into war but these moments seem to flit by without consequence and the most recent one the flight of vince foster nostalgia was actually defused by the hyperventilations of overreaction as the voices of punditry gasped at his doubts on the official foster story millions old enough to remember thought hmmm the clintons the scandals the various pressures of covering for them foster repeated frustrations with the washington whirlwind the decades of envelope-pushing by bill and hillary ever since know what maybe not so sure what happened either this is not lunacy and it was not some egregious gaffe to invoke images of the earliest vestiges of clinton skullduggery he rooted for people to lose their homes in the recession housing collapse this is straight from the den of lies that is the democrat party advertising brain trust they found audio of trump in musing about how drop in home prices could provide buying opportunities that could be of benefit to investors the history of such logic dates to neanderthals hoping tiger pelts would dip in value to grease the wheels of commerce years ago yet elizabeth warren who we learn has pocketed some cash from house flip or two lashed out against trump cruelty for actively wishing for homeowners to lose everything there are only two explanations for an attack this baseless genuine stupidity and malicious intent let just say she is not stupid and finally he is only doing this for his own ego no doubt the man has stratospheric self-image and doesn mind telling us so but this has been trait of his for the decades we have known him does he engage in business deals for his own image or because he wants them to succeed has he plunged into various ventures from the usfl to the miss america pageant for his own image or because he wanted them to succeed he clearly wishes to succeed at everything he does so why would this not extend to running the country this does not mean will necessarily agree with his every instinct but if he genuinely pursues the things he talks about with determination and seriousness there will be far more positive results than negative in the end rather have president interested in actually doing things that will make him look good than the last seven and half years of president who does whatever he wants because he thinks he is already omniscient and omnipotent and if at the end of his presidency the country will have been truly benefited trump will enjoy the enormous benefit of an even loftier list of achievements and we might enjoy the benefit of an america made at least in some ways great again you re welcome vote trump in	0

and why isjeb spending so much money slaming ribio he shoud be slaming trump and cruz instead but no matter what he should stop hi campaign now along withthe rest of the gang only trump cruz and rubio can do the job	0
the only reason marco rubio is still considered viable candidate is that the so called fair and balanced news media is too obsessed with hillary mails to see ribio for who he is	0
seriously the whole clintonize the record campaign and all the people supporting it and cranking the gears in the machine have already proven anyone still on the hill bandwagon is about as low-information as any trump voter	0

he was the german chancellor who convinced president paul von hidenburg that appointing the leader of an upstart party to the cabinet would placate them and that said leader could be contained that leader was adolf hitler the party the nazis month after the deal was struck the reichstag burned the rest is history	0
also worth noting that the spd had supported the reactionary hindenburg for president of germany using literal lesser evil argument of well at least he not hitler then hidenburg appointed hitler chancellor	0
trump says something amazingly stupid and his numbers go up in flames quicker than the hidenburg	0
effectively the weimar republic sucked at democracy and the people since they weren used to the democratic process elected strongmen to take control also the leaders of the republic were pretty weak until people like hidenburg the same one from ww and later hitler took control	0
hitler came to power because the weimar republic was built on flawed ideas also the germans were not used to democratic ideas so they chose to elect strongmen like hidenburg to do whatever they wanted	0
for one we have stricter system of checks and balances the weimar republic pretty much was walk-in for any strongman whether it was hidenburg or hitler	0

ll bet all those hirees are based offshore not subject to us laws like obamacre epa if so it makes sense by shedding obamacare and other regulatory costs mickydees can continue to sell burgers fries soda for under bucks and continue in business otherwise they well may have to jack up prices to meet the obamacare regulatory costs and soon be staring bankruptcy in the face if folks are willing to pay lot higher prices for stuff how much you say how much has your obamacare healthcare premium increased stand up and say so else dump the democrats and vote trump pence	0
the country is going to hell we don have time for this clown to realize that he is suppoting obamacre now wake the hell up	0
talking about trump support of the obamacre mandate and you re talking about freaking picture what wrong with you people	0

yes aarp was for obamacre	0
so do the architects of obamacre	0
yea but the obama hobbit will say hey quit being racist because you hate obamacare because obama is black when in reality you pretty upset because obamacre has driven you healthcare costs thru the roof in many cases cost you pay because you hours were cut if you didn lose your job but relax we insured bunch of year olds who shouldn be living in heir mommies basement because they are to lazy to get job or if they have one it doesn pay enough because of obamas failed economy has driven down wages but again relaxer hillary is coming to the rescue by expanding obamacare to all those illegal immigrants and refugees she wants bring to our nation	0
the sheep will go willingly to slaughter the same gruberites the left used jonathan gruber we relied on the stupidity of the american voter to get obamacre passed and to accept hillary account of what happened in benghazi and the irs scandal and the nsa scandal etc etc are still out there in force they literally care more about trees and lions with names than they do about this country they want no borders and they above all else want power and your money they have the power and gruber was spot on these people voting for his version of utopia are stupid talking the masses into passing laws or simple presidential mandates will be enough to outlaw them then one by one they will make felons out of average citizens take their guns they will lose their jobs and be locked up because they are bad people	0

you know what could selectively cut and past things for any candidate running in this election and paint picture look at actions and consistency in actions and rhetoric so far cruz has been the most consistent on everything from fighting the rinos on obama executive amnesty and funding obamacare cruz has always been against common core obamacre net neutrailty mass amnesty and pathway to citizenship and cruz has been very vocal about strong and enforced borders cruz has been very vocal about removing corporate welfare and subsidies and cruz has been very vocal about the climate hoax cruz has been hit hard by the fox news pundits for standing up to the rinos and like that cruz did not sit back and say nothing	0
maybe mr brooks is not one of those gop member who is against president obama because of the color of his skin but surely think that has been major reason why so many are against him br br what else could explain the birthers while none of the other that crazy trumpm raise the issue whether or not cruz is natural born after all both have indisputedly american mothers and cruz was certifiably born outside the us what else could explain the most important task for the gop is to make sure obama is one term president what else could explain the venom against obamacre when so many elements in it especially the mandate were positioned once proposed by the gop and their think tanks themselves	0

conservatives claim they are the party of fiscal responsibility but cut taxes to irresponsibly low levels causing record deficits and piling on the debt put two decade-long wars of occupation on the credit card crashed the economy in by deregulating the financial markets in and then stood in the way of any and every attempt to remedy the situation to keep the economy in the dumps so that obama would not get reelected conservatives claim they are the party that best manages foreign policy and most loves the military but they sunk the us into decade long quagmire in iraq over made up reasons no less sunk to trillion into it cost the lives of and the maiming of of of our troops destabilized the middle east created the conditions that allowed extremist fundamentalist groups to flourish and removed the only check on iran conservatives claim they are for small government and freedom but are responsible for the rise of the surveillance and police state by pushing the patriot act when liberals warned that law would infringe on our rights and privacy conservatives questioned our patriotism and claimed we wanted the us to be attacked again today they lay the blame firmly at obama feet instead of taking responsibility for conservative failures and reassessing your ideology the conservatives instead double down they claim the reason for these failures is that they were not conservative enough the conservatives have taken very dangerous turn towards the far right and are toying with fascism just like all fascists throughout history all like to label everyone else commie just like all fascists all purge those deemed not pure enough rinos and replace them with ever more radical extremists just like all fascist all believe that only your ideology should be implemented regardless of how many democrats the american people elect into office just like all fascists all claim that it is only your party that loves the nation and all others are trying to destroy it just like all fascists all rely on fear based agenda nicely wrapped in platitudes bumper sticker slogans and tired talking points that their ill-informed and propaganda-fed base eats up and regurgitates whole upon closer inspection it is clear that the conservative vision for america is that of theocratic fascist confederate science-denying polluted unregulated robber baron dystopia these are not the principles this nation was founded on the biggest threat to this nation is not the taliban it the tealiban	1
you are clearly just bigot who hates the south and you have chip on your shoulder anyone who uses such juvenile term such as the tealiban should automatically be disqualified from an argument as total partisan raving mouth breathing statist lemming whether it be your sexuality or white guilt that has been brainwashed into you from an early age you just can seem to approach political discussion with any level of independent thought the country credit rating has been downgraded we are now to china our infrastructure is crumbling progressives in dc run up debt and spend it on nothing more than slush funds and lining their corporate buddies pocketbooks nsa is spying on innocent americans irs is targeting private citizens and organizations for their religious and political views the federal reserve is just printing money out of thin air the president is acting like dictator and rewriting laws without congress obamacare the president is shredding the constitution by rewriting our immigration policy by executive fiat record numbers on food stamps record numbers out of the workforce and cultural rot and decay everywhere you see and somehow in your tiny brain your biggest concern is big bad boogeyman conservative administration that has never happened obama is the one acting like facist trashing our constitution and engaging in power grab after power grab our country is one step away from looking like the dystopia in detroit under democrat leadership and yet you keep drinking the dnc kool aid our country is far too over regulated and the economy and the people need some breathing room we need return to our founding principles respect for the rule of law and constitution and functioning economy with people actually working and getting rich we have proof we are not going to get that with democrats so that leaves us with the only form of leadership that hasn been tried since the unabashed unapologetic conservatism too bad you are too compromised too much of sell out or too stupid to realize this	1

what really strange is the tealiban and the southern baptists think that tea or weed or devil weed is the spawn of satan but that whiskey and terbaccy or snoose as they call it chew are christ blood there are so many rules in their religion it hard to keep up you know if distilled moonshine is ok with their crypto-gods why not distilled crak same-same after hearing those tealiban mullahs spout their fatwahs against this or that it not hard to understand why for their kids methisnowtheirfavoritepasstime	1
find it ironic that the mechiko politico condemns others when his government is under so much hot water for the human rights abuses and murderous security forces he regularly uses to kill protestors against his regime yeah those teachers were really dangerous best to kill some and intimidate the rest funny how trudope didn bring that up during the crooks summit	1
we had dependable leader who actually understood economics but had no use for the msm and as result they turned on him harper was not mr charisma and he paid for it firmly believe that the history books will be very kind to him though as he accomplished many good things for canada now we have mr selfie he embarrasses the fukk out of us trudope came along promising the world to all of the silly servants unions and special interest groups who ate it up like sirloin steak but it was all bovine scatagory trudope promised to legalize pot and to run small deficit of billion per year the small deficit has grown to billion wtf pot is still illegal pulled out jets out of the fight against isis wtf gave billions away to fight climate change wtf trudope says that he will grow the budget from the heart out but common sense says if you think you can spend your way to prosperity you re dreaming in technicolor trudope only won with of the popular vote in reality most canadians did not vote for this bummer clone all down below the th need to help counteract the damage by getting trump elected	1
we canucks need this muppet like we need transgender crappers there is strong silent majority that is as sick as our brethren beneath the th we are hoping the gop gets its knuckles wrapped for fudging with the primaries and hope to see trump take office once bummer is evicted really looking fwd to trump giving that freak trudope what for on immigration and other common interests	1
trudope is the biggest and worst joke to ever grace canadian political culture	1
how canadian residing in canada we have trudope for the next years learn from the mistakes we made up here in the last election	1
even trudope wonders at the point of th eu now	1
trudope to break immigration records in canada we re told more which is probably mere fraction the true projection these globalist creeps agree upon behind closed doors it just the beginning my neighbourhood changed dramatically more to follow	1
hey ellen you should be in canada campaigning for justine trudope of course ellen may not be able to appreciate hair	1
cal him trudope	1
maybe boi trudope has an accident and gets rushed to military hospital	1
trudope is quisling metro-sexual drama teacher that is totally clueless	1
it good thing trudope is importing more of these lunatics	1
this guy called canadians out as racist and urged us along with trudope to welcome and embrace islam more yesterday and our immigration minister keeps scaremongering us about how we re in dire need of more iimmigration they re about to bring in another giant wave of muslims although they know we resent it more of us are moving to the country	1
within the first week of this clown mayorhood he flew allah posters on buses and banned the protein world bikini ones in the tube even if he were not tied to radical islam and he most certainly is he bad news and has hidden agenda he just came to my country and gave condescending sound bite on how racist we canadians are and then announced that we must welcome and embrace islam more the audacity of these globalist hacks albeit shocking would be funny if the cultural stakes weren so high and seeing trudope and the khan-con so early today made me throw up in my own mouth at the breakfast table	1
please win trump---watching trudope having to engage with you after all his globalist trash talk will be hilarious and awesome canada	1

as someone who isn trumpite doesn trust cruz who reminds me of creepy televangelist yeah did	0
will admit sometimes it is difficult for me to understand the point of trumpite my point is that in illinois the board of elections has declared cruz is natural born citizen this is the same opinion as is stated by constitutional scholars simply thought you might consider that challenges being made about cruz eligibility are being proven wrong	0
who said anything about standing down all did was recommend that you be angry at the right people not trumpite and would rather eat rusty nail than support that human brain aneurysm if you re going to be angry at strangers on the internet at all in my experience it mostly waste of time and energy	0
national review is joke the vile and loathsome dirtbag lowlife lowry virulent anti trumpite is disgrace and should have been fired some time ago his henchmen foreigner cooke and slimy kevin williamson are too disgusting to discuss	0
expect nothing less from trumpite keepin it classy as usual god bless you	0

all the class of true trumpite clearly the thinking of one of the good ol dixiecrat corrupters who lost their gravy train when bill clinton began the legal crackdown on arkansas traditional thieves as fifth generation member of three of the original kentucky settlement pioneers of the ouachita do believe we have slightly better understanding of the dixiecrat likes of orval faubus than you and your trump apologists will ever comprehend among the controlling politicians bankers large delta plantation owners and dominant businessmen there was not an ounce of honor ethics or decency coercing some woman to charge any man threatening their gravy trains is one of the more common techniques of that kkk krowd	0
trump is trumpite not conservative nationalist and protectionist with socialist leanings	0
see my unhoned dulled verbal barblettes from my tattered quiver have struck home with indubitable accuracy in that truly mushy empty orb you call head as watch the slow weeping from the wound hear the faintly audible interrogatives echoing randomly from the empty barbletted cranium what secret society immunity mercenary scumbag deviously duplicious it sounds like babbling trumpite slurring his last devilishly-hateful incoherent and inciteful attempt to be immortalized in his own barbletted yet already dead mind	0

watched it glenn little nuts sometimes and knows it but that doesn mean his speech wasn outstanding and if you were truly conservative you would have applied it to big donors the establishment and even romney would tell anyone to listen to hear the bigger issue of how important the constitution really is to us our kids and all of our futures but obviously you are blind trumpite and can see past any real or imagined insults to your guy the same guy might point out that is lying to you to get your support and deep inside you know it which makes you even madder too bad it was good speech with good message	0
it deplorables irredeemables and trumpite trash against the world go trump let get out there and make sure we have an overwhelming victory	0
if trump is that and not trumpite then you re self-professed arrogant jackass having the intellect of bug which is nothing more than liberal cockroach who gets his meals from the cardboard marxists	0
it is just fine if you have some kind of opinion about relatively minor and controversial issue like this one knock yourself out the problem is we have real and serious issues that go well beyond whether government or businesses use eminent domain for roads factories and developments of this sort or that to call this fascism is absolutely juvenile ridiculous and frankly embarrassing to conservatism maybe we should get taste of real fascism in this country so you prima donnas can understand the difference and stop abusing the word we have government completely out of control and under the control of special interest trillion dollar debt an economy of million unemployed and invasion of illegals in the tens of millions and have to read idiot articles about trump position on eminent domain like he is some kind of monster hitler and now unworthy of being president am not trump supporter per se so keep the your trite and stupid responses about me being trumpite some of you out here that are not trolls but think you are conservatives really need to grow up man you are so easily played and you wonder why conservatives never get elected nor why you have no real political representation you throw anyone overboard at the slightest provocation whether it is the liberal media smearing them or few so-called misguided and foolish conservative writers with an agenda it is pathetic you can not seem to keep focus on who the real enemy is nor realize that all this circular firing squad bs and exaggeration actually destroys any chance of even electing moderately conservative and sincere candidate it so dam predictable its sickening you fools will end up with bush and rubio so remember this rambling rant when it happens and let us not hear the usual whining later spare me that at least	0

there are plenty of frightening people joining trump movement people who probably can wait to slap on crisp badge and smart uniform the latest editions to the trump clothing line of course and start doing whatever their dear orange leader commands but think it important not to paint with too broad brush many of trump supporters back him not because they re hopeless dyed-in-the-wool fascists but because they have genuine fears and grievances that he exploiting if we re going to stop this movement in its tracks we need to understand that not every trumpite is klansman or neo-nazi and that demagogic clowns like trump base their success not just on hate and ignorance but on desperation there needs to be not only mass resistance to him but real viable alternative to what he represents	0

tds as with other trump fanatics you choose to hear what you want to from him ignoring the past statements that said just the opposite he came out with the border rhetoric only because he knew that the gullible voters on the right would accept it without question the subject of syrian refugees is perfect example he stated at various times that the had to let them in that none should be allowed that some should be allowed that few should be allowed and that we should deal with the issue later he knew that there were blind followers on the left who would give him credit for things he never stood for and that they would ignore the rest of his wavering and contradictory statements you confidently state what you believe he would do when there has been nothing other than general statements with little to no detail trump will do and say what is politically expedient for trump as he has zero integrity believability or strength of character from which to make any principiled decisions to do the right things for the american people go on as you are tds telling yourself that you aren blind even as you blindly follow this false conservative and political poser just as obama mind-numbed minions did for him trump has zero consistency has said anything no matter how untrue in order to win and does arrogantly believe that voters such as you would excuse any action from him no matter how evil and self-serving evidently he is right as see the perpetually blind on the right excusing his every excess and ignoring his every lie you can give him license for being the next abuser of the constitution but simply won you are one more voter that has my sympathy which extends to every mind-numbed trumpite that values rhetoric of substance and petulant egotism over strength of character	0

problem about accepting or denying science is that it is function of the powerful political or industrial we ve got to face the fact that the majority of the human race is not equipped to analyze the data and decide for themselves br br even if all are created equal even if we are all equal in the eyes of god we are not equal in our capacity to comprehend the consequences of global or even national actions of humans recall many discussions that foundered on that fact one very nice man wanted to discuss the problems of workers and the middle class but when mentioned outsourcing and globalization he threw his hands up and said that such issues were beyond him br br this is challenge for democracy and for leadership the solution is not some kind of exclusion test better to have all inside the tent than to have many outside throwing grenades mmmm is that what happened with the tea party and the trumpite grenade throwers	0

the founding fathers were aware that it was possible to elect rogue president so they seperated the power of the government and created mechanisms to control the rogue the felt that if president were to go rogue they felt that the power of congress to reign him in or remove him from office would have the desired effect to preserve the republic they never intended to have to contend with president as disgusting as bho or the rino farm congress in their wildest nightmares there has been alot of damage to within the government that can certainly be repaired while the social damage racial devision immorality fraud theft lies treasonous acts etc that bho and the complicit rinos will leave behind in will be the most difficult items to repair	0

dana perino is third rate hack she is one of the most left-leaning people at fox she is too far left to even be considered rino would put her in the category of demopublican it is shame that so many of these have been able to take control of fox it is sad state of affairs that this abject conflict of interest has not been brought forth by fox but had to be uncovered by breitbart and others who was the biggest loser at thursday night debates fox news	1
he demopublican it doesnt really matter which side of the party he on the party thrown by the same owners	1
or is not demopublican	1
agreed if the current incredible trends away from conventional establishment mainstream demopublican greed and corruption are any indicator say that there is huge and growing market for truly conservative news network personally my trust is pretty much limited to mark levin and tom fitton judicial watch all the others are moving targets	1
very disappointing mitt what are you republicrat or demopublican believe global warming occurs just as global cooling does but not that catastrophic anthropogenic human-made global warming has been proven the former part of planet natural cycle the latter world largest to-date hoax founded by politicized scientists who dismissed the scientific method	1
the democrat and demopublican didn make monster with trump they gave us the second coming of reagan he may not be as eloquent as reagan but he will get the job done	1
by we in we have to find way to sort through the stuff on the internet he means the government of absolute and permanent power the demopublican party sharing power taking credit for accidental successes and blaming each other for inevitable failures cracking down on the internet will allow monopoly of propagandists to speak for the republicratic demopublican party and fashion tyranny watch for this more and more talk about wild wild west internet means censorship and denial of free speech	1

palin is unique because she always has way of getting to the heart of an issue the elite demopublican establishment is presently creating hundreds maybe thousands of well-paid jobs for goon squad workers there plenty of demand out there thanks to the desires of the american voters to vote out of office the elite establishment that thinks it owns the country	1
in retrospect the decline of the lp was preordained the lp is political party inside the system of statist coercion it is subject to the same forces that operate within the demopublican and republicrat parties it was inevitable that variant of gresham law would assert itself and the bad would drive out the good know this is going to come across as dogmatic but no trace of political coercion may be allowed to taint socio-economic order otherwise it is doomed its eventual downfall will not be matter of whether but when	1
trump can gain enough support to run as an independent screw the demopublican uniparty	1
typical of another child of foreigners standing up for amnesty and foreign invasion another establishment tool of the demopublican party	1
it demopublican fire sale all rino must go	1
kentuckians presumably have as much actual input as to who is elected in their state as the rest of the states controlled by demopublican machines	1
the demopublican uniparty is globalist front to fool the gullible into thinking they have two-party system that cares about the will of the people	1
truly demopublican	1

we may well find out will vote trump given any opportunity primary then general election not leftist or rightist an american and want is what is right or best for america and it seems to me trump comes closest to what is needed to destroy the republicrat demopublican uni-party	1

the one where we re trillion in debt with trillion in future unfunded welfare state liabilities and the magic fix it team is either hillary coffin clinton on the ticket and donald got some magic beans to sell trump on the ticket and finally on the libertarian ticket confused demopublican named gary johnson whose claim to fame is climbing mountains and calling trump yep in that bizarro world	1
the right wing is as socialist as the left the dems and repuplicans are just two sides of the demopublican globalist uniparty fake choice to fool the gullible that why an outsider like trump can fix this mess and that why both halves of the uniparty are fighting him with all their might	1
can figure out whether he is demopublican or republicrat it is hard to tell the difference without lifting their tail up	1
everytime demopublican opens their mouth to tell us this isn who we are all it proves is that they don know us very well	1
as long as an establishment demopublican hack that doesn mess up the pay schedules or inadvertently benefit the citizens is put into office the msm will be happy	1
the importance of what finemand says is that the elites understand well that americans are waking up trump continues to grow in popularity and as threat to the establishment of both demopublican and republicrat parties trump cannot be excused entirely but he isn responsible for the fact that his message resonates so widely and with such levels of support those who are responsible are anyone who attempts to force their agenda upon us because by doing so they demonstrate they do not represent us obama says we ought be ashamed for not welcoming with open arms immigrants and refugee fascist democrats republicans act regardless of our interests openly defying both the rule of law and the will of the people our country is not anything like it was prior to the establishment of the tyranny of obama our traditions our history our very culture wasn and isn what obama wants for us he and michelle told us we have to have country that byotch can be proud of and it isn one where we the people have power or rights any longer	1

you should have learned by now the left doesn care what rules we play by except to skewer us with go read rules for radicals it one of their tenets they turn our rules against us while they don abide by any such limitations on social decorum they don care if you treat them nice or civily they still trash sarah palin and say the most disgusting things about her and her family where have you been for the last years they ll call you racist stupid homophobic mysogynistic islamophobic etc and know that you won say boo back to them because you have an ethical stance you re playing gin rummy they re playing hockey and the refs media have been payed off until as society we re willing to hold the media who almost solely permit and drive the hypocrisy accountable for their partiality our words will always be used against us no matter then intent meanwhile no one on the left will be held accountable for their actions and words our civility is sign of weakness to the left and they use it to get away with everything knowing that the media will support them no matter what so you can either continue to be belittled by the left and see what has happened to palin and many many others repeated ad nauseum or you can stop caring about what the left thinks hillary dresses like mao it not comment on her as person just an observation about her idiotic attire that matches her ideology carly fiorina dresses very well from all that ve seen it has nothing to do with her political positions just that she presents herself well just like ted cruz does or bill clinton does	0
it reached point where the race cards and islamophobic cards are tattered and dog eared we don care anymore	0

it amazing to me that telling the truth is considered racist xenophobic or islamophobic	0
whether you believe trump or not as his views are in contradiction when compared to his own words in earlier times the words today are what have sparked the protests which threaten violence and those words are long overdue the entitled illegal and professional victim has been called out trump is saying illegals are that who cross the border islam is our enemy which it is and we don owe the professional parasite which we don and the marxist reacts as they did in let me be illegal the alien from mexico cries when in fact every one of them caught should have been arrested maybe we can deport all million we start with one million this year black lives matter not criminal black lives with which the other half of black america caters to---the criminal the entitled the lazy we shouldn put memorial up for michael brown--we should give former officer wilson medal he islamophobic sure hope so because the muslim has been such an asset in europe wonder if brussels or germany is now regretting their professional tolerance to barbaric cultures these are the cries that make up the protests backed by the drop out from college or graduate who found his degree in philosophy isn going to get him six figures in today economy or the minimal wage earner who still at thirty thinks he should live like the rest of us with no development of skills don know if trump would actually do what he says but his words causing upheaval if the marxist movement continues there will only be one way to solve it in the end--known as the second amendment charles hurst author of the second fall the prophetic novel of america apocalypse and creator of the runningwolf ezine the patriots guide to the long lost art of common sense	0
you forgot islamophobia forgetting that is itself islamophobic	0
she ll probably say the woman was using islamophobic language towards her you know the go-to excuse of dnc	0
left and right is distraction the real question is whether you support the advancement of the globalist agenda open borders and one world government totalitarian society or whether you support national sovereignty everything you are witnessing falls into one of the above two groups although most establishment is supporting the globalist agenda including the government and its institutions the msm corporations and so on political correctness is mostly used to silence dissent and so anyone who opposes open borders illegal immigration and the erosion of old boundaries and laws of society is immediately classed as irrelevant because they are racist xenophobic islamophobic and so on the reality is that most not all simply value the role of family community and freedom and recognise that big government that appears to be actively breaking down the fabric of society is leading towards totalitarian state and the erosion of our freedoms	0

next up the msm will be full of the dreaded and so-far mostly unseen islamophobic backlash and of course increased protection for muslims and mosques- because of islamic inspired violence and muslims committing violent crime it so upside down it offensive if anyone is any doubt that eurabia and eurislam are on the eu agenda and being driven relentlessly forward- one need only observe the thousands of jihadists allowed back into europe from syria of whom andrew gilligan described the returning to the uk as battle-hardened and vengeful jihad is to be managed in culturally equivalent manner ie just like british lads going to spain in the it is to be spoken of in non-emotive manner as the eu lexicon suggests disassociating islam terror and jihad can you imagine during the cold war being called commiephobic when exposing the soviet union methods and beliefs yet here we are under attack but our leaders think not talking about it will make it go away and refuse to name the enemy in fact perpetuating huge lie that it is religion of peace all european politicians who support eurabia are traitors and collaborators with islamo-fascism- they might have lofty notions of progress and economic development of the mena but when it comes down to brass tacks- they are on the side of islamo-fascism and sharia law so instead of questions of why muslims are inspired by violent islamic scripture that tells them to despise and attack the unbeliever and slay them in hundred different ways the msm and western authorities will instead focus on the west discrimination or foreign policies that will supposedly have driven this girl to act one ex-muslim put it best here in brietbart the religion that causes the most bloodshed is being protected the most find that totally paradoxical and sometimes by those who carry the banner of gender equality multiculturalism and the right to sexual self-determination but if islamists set the tone freedom of expression homosexuality and women rights will soon be finished wonder what makes these people tick total naivety or are they afraid of the truth afraid of the truth- the eu can let europeans see what their actual plans are and what the consequences of allowing millions of muslim males into europe are- replacement migration and fusion with north africa and the middle east is being forced on europe against the will of the majority of europeans while pro-eurabians say we can report that murder rape etc because it would be gift to the far-right what they really mean is we can let europeans see what replacement migration from the middle east and north africa actually looks like- that the crime rates will predictably skyrocket- especially rape- which makes all pro-eurabians complicit and covered in the blood of countless victims- because they knew what was coming but said nothing- worse they lied and continue to lie about the nature of islam in many places they covered up the industrial-scale racist rape and enslavement of tens of thousand of girls because it would be gift these mps and eurabians deserve to see justice- doubt they will but who knows things can change and change quickly- the look of surprise on elites dragged out their palaces and offices by angry mobs are always the same	0

the step-by-step guide to fighting terrorism express outrage decry how reprehensible the terrorists are and call them names coward seems to be popular these days not that suicide bombers care after they re dead set lofty but intangible goals make impassioned pleas for unity solidarity and other high minded appeals but make sure the goals have no objective way of actually being accomplished how exactly do you measure unity denounce anyone who actually tries to do anything any concrete proposals regarding immigration trade or military action must be shouted down as racist bigotry bonus points if you ironically argue that doing something about terrorism only means the terrorist have won like we don restrict passports in sweden doing something like that means you ve given in to the terrorists and let them win congratulate yourself no war on terrorism is complete until you ve patted yourself on the back for rising above the no doubt islamophobic urge of to preserve your county and culture for future generations repeat after the next bomb blast could the final step of this plan be anything else	0

why not just send migrants of them back from where they came from since according to how they are trying to duplicate the environment they left they are not feeling well in eu climate they would be better off in the environment with which they are familiar with practicing the familiar habits which aren compatible with eu customs and laws and forcing them to integrate which is if we look at mena migrants second and third generation living in eu something that they are apparently not capable of doing would be according to amnesty international various charities and human rights activist racist and islamophobic so yeah just send them back into the middle east and africa in the environment which they miss so much that they are trying to recreate in europe	0

where is the msm to label these muslims islamophobic	0
contrary to popular islamophobic belief the concept of taqiyya is relatively unimportant and not actually blanket endorsement of deception towards non-muslims this is what the encyclopedia britannica has to say about it taqiyyah in islam the practice of concealing one belief and foregoing ordinary religious duties when under threat of death or injury derived from the arabic word waqa to shield oneself taqiyyah defies easy translation english renderings such as precautionary dissimulation or prudent fear partly convey the term meaning of self-protection in the face of danger to oneself or by extension and depending upon the circumstances to one fellow muslims thus taqiyyah may be used for either the protection of an individual or the protection of community moreover it is not used or even interpreted in the same way by every sect of islam taqiyyah has been employed by the sh ites the largest minority sect of islam because of their historical persecution and political defeats not only by non-muslims but also at the hands of the majority sunni sect neither the qur nor the hadith decrees points of doctrine or prescribes guidelines for behaviour when using taqiyyah the circumstances in which it may be used and the extent to which it is obligatory have been widely disputed by islamic scholars according to scholarly and judicial consensus it is not justified by the threat of flogging temporary imprisonment or other relatively tolerable punishments the danger to the believer must be unavoidable also while taqiyyah may involve disguising or suppressing one religious identity it is not license for shallow profession of faith oaths taken with mental reservation for example are justified on the basis that god accepts what one believes inwardly consideration of community rather than private welfare is stressed in most cases in other words it minor debatable doctrine only meant to apply to very specific circumstances and most muslims don even believe in it what more there are dozens of sayings in the qur an and the hadith that consistently condemn falsehoods and extol muslims to speak and seek the truth here an excellent article from hussein ibish on the subject	0
all this happy horse hockey makes me smile while the pantsuit goes around changing her position on every issue and buries herself with idiotic statements like the terrorists have nothing to do with islam americans look more and more to candidates like trump who aren afraid to tell the truth while the self immolating media burns itself out they fail to notice that voters have had it with the current political how polloi voters are sick of illegal immigrants political correctness self aggrandizing media personalities the labels of racist homophobe islamophobic etc we have had it with political bullies who want to silence anyone who refuses to toe the leftist line we are sick to death of being told that tolerance and diversity mean that anyone who disagrees with the latest special interest group need re-education the day of reckoning is coming and it won be push polled or bullied by brown shirts when hear lifelong friends who have always voted dem saying they are being forced to consider trump know that the self named intelligentsia have gone too far trump for president unthinkable only couple of years ago but not anymore out of control political correctness that refuses to call muslim muslim and suffocates free thought is responsible	0

don like picking on kids but he does seem like little pr ck as additional info comes out it seems more likely that he wanted to get disciplined for being muslim don know the exact reason but his father is likely behind it he just brought the clock to school for no reason it was the first school day after he showed it to his engineering teacher who told him to put it away and don show it to anyone else he showed it to everyone else but got no islamophobic reaction so in english class he plugs the clock in and sets the alarm the alarm goes off and he finally gets reaction still no islamophobia he jerks off the teacher school officials and police who tire of his game and haul his ass in note that the only photo of him in handcuffs was taken by his sister now he celebrity the press must now realize that they ve been had but they never admit mistake especially one that would kill narrative this is obama mission accomplished moment but the press will cover for him yet again am taking side bets on the odds that the kid never gets to the white house	0

here the post again they keep censuring me by repeatedly deleting it can you read it and tell me what did wrong by the way post it for me to see if they will delete it when you post it when you import an influx of muslims you get jihad it hardly rocket science the west faces jihad terror because certain percentage of the muslim population will kill in the cause of islam actually mass muslim immigration with all of its excess baggage under any circumstances is really migration jihad waged deliberately non-violently via stealth to invade and infiltrate in mass non-muslim infidel societies institutions governments and god knows what else to facilitate mass casualty attacks and at the same time to subvert non-muslim infidel societies from within for eventual demographic conquest the fact of the matter is jihad waged deliberately non-violently via stealth is astronomically far more prevalent relative to jihad waged via violence which is qital jihad of the sword and furthermore islamic terrorism is but just one form of many forms of qital in other words it is insane to vet and screen muslims only to stop islamic terrorists as it totally ignores the fact that astronomically far more jihad is waged deliberately non-violently for instance to invade and infiltrate non-muslim infidel societies to facilitate mass casualty attacks and to subvert us from within for eventual demographic conquest relative to jihad that is waged via violence the biggest problem that we all have not only with respect to the eu but also throughout most of the world including in the usa as well today is the fact that virtually all political elites on both sides of the political aisles universally hold islam to be so-called religion of peace morally equivalent to all other religions in fact that is the prevailing politically correct narrative throughout most of the world that suffices for the truth today and anyone and everyone who goes against that politically correct truth is automatically deemed and marginalized to be racist islamophobic bigot despite the fact that an estimated million non-muslim people have been brutally murdered in cold-blood by muslims in jihad driven perpetually by the ideological force of islam non-stop in the preceding years indeed it very similar to the insanity of manmade global warming in many regions of the world where anyone and everyone who goes against that politically correct nonsense are all automatically marginalized as kooks furthermore since at least the hijra in ad islam has not been so-called religion of peace morally equivalent to all other religions as islam in stark contrast to all other religions is both religion and an extremely radical form of totalitarianism that seeks world supremacy as its sole fundamental purpose all rolled up into one in addition the totalitarian aspects of islam take precedence over the religious aspects of islam which means that islam in effect is an extremely radical form of totalitarianism very similar to nazism and communism more than it is anything else and in fact it is actually quite bit worse than both of them were in fact there is no freedom of conscience in islam allowed because sharia which is draconian islamic totalitarian law the will of allah is all encompassing in that it controls every single aspect of muslim life down to the minutest of details in effect all muslims in the world are the slaves of allah and the few that refuse to remain the slaves of allah are summarily executed for apostasy and according to the doctrines of islam as the only freedom that sharia allows is the freedom for muslims to become more devout slaves of allah yet juncker and the other european commission authorities are not moving to stop the migrant influx but to crush dissent from parties that want to save europe free and pluralistic societies the same exact thing is also happening over here in america as well for instance when donald trump proposed temporary moratorium on mass muslim immigration with all of its excess baggage until our officials can figure out why all these islamic terrorist attacks are happening over here and around the world dhimmicrat and republican politicians alike teamed up together to vilify and demonize trump as racist islamophobic bigot in fact it still going on today the problem for them is the fact that their new immigrants hate europeans too well the enemy muslim invaders that the republicans and dhimmicrats alike are all conspiring together to import into america as fast as they can also hate americans too meanwhile both republicans and dhimmicrats alike today are also guilt-tripping americans by claiming that religious test should not be used to exclude out immigrants and refugees because it morally wrong nonetheless would like those aforementioned republicans and dhimmicrats to please show me where the first amendment of the constitution establishment clause protects what is both religion and an extremely radical form of totalitarianism that seeks world supremacy as its sole fundamental purpose all rolled up into one and where the free exercise clause of the first amendment of the constitution protects individual muslims rights to practice sharia and to wage jihad against fellow american non-muslim infidels anyway we can all look and shake our respective heads at all the insanity manifesting in europe today but at the same time we must not overlook all the insanity that is happening right over here in america at the same time as well	0
on the pc scale of who is the most racist and islamophobic east europeans would be number incredibly as it seems followed by southern europe then the alpine regions then nothing for some time then germany and france holland denmark belgium the uk and then the bottom sweden	0

xenophobia fascism discrimination being nativists anti-immigrant anti-hispanic white supremacists etc and we find such accusations offensive this is about the economic survival of our nation citizenry thus we are absolutely anti-parasite moocher leech sponger bloodsucker freeloader etc for millions of american citizens of latino hispanic descent this is about honor integrity morals values self-respect our belief in the rule of law that the us is sovereign nation that supersedes shared blood ancestry heritage thus to suggest that we would even consider abandoning those very values

have lot to say about this first of all saw kelly do that live and thought it was inappropriate and major tv network should never be using politico as trusted unbiased source that they can just break news with politco is biased and is daily beast huffington post and yes breitbart there nothing wrong with websites that have bias or have vision or have an outlook or whatever you call it online sites are supposed to provide content to fill in the blanks and to cover things the networks don cover and to connect the dots they are not supposed to be cbs fox nbc cspan etc second of all when kelly story about candidate hillary having direct connection to and paying democracy partners and activists and pacs that is separate story than those same activists or other candidate activists supplying stories to news outlets and bloggers two entirely different things hillary is candidate for gods sake there are laws to prevent that third parties can participate in the political process and do anything they want and bloggers and newsies can print anything they want third it obvious kelly is anti trump from day one so take what she says about trump and breitbart with grain of salt fourth it also just as clear that breitbart is pro trump and has been for long time which is why here every day and can see why conservatives in the gop would feel breitbart is no friend the state of the gop right now is shifting there civil war or multiple civil wars and you can really blame any one entity for advancing their perspective and their cause but we do want transparency as readers fifth the trump candidacy is unique thing trump is not just another gop candidate he an anti-establishment candidate and anti-globalist and reformer so the people allied with him are going to share that vision which means it not about red blue it about the vision and about truth that is why am here am democratic operative no am an american voted dem for years and never would have even considered voting gop until trump came along the cruz people would not like me moderate not hard core conservative the anti-wikileaks rubio would not like me because for free speech and transparency and against globalism the bush people would not like me because bush and clinton are basically one family trump brings bigger tent to the gop but also different tent this is unique political situation and it steps on lot of toes and confuses lot of people including apparently kelly do folks on the left ad right have something in common yes and that should surprise no one because americans have something in common with each other and are not just to be characterized as red or blue in fact bernie supporters should vote for trump some of them anyway but know they won because most of them want to break the system but oddly at the same time will prefer it stay the same rather than risk supposed racist and sexist and islamophobic candidate win this election remember is not just about foreign policy and economics jobs it very much about cultural war as well and the berniebots are restricted by their very very narrow view on social issues having said all that looked at the link to your old story and read your breitbart explanation of events and have to say you re walking fine line in terms of trying to be just regular journalists covering story during the primary as explained before see you as kind of counterpoint to huffington post which is also biased so see nothing wrong with it to begin with to your credit in the old story you reveal that black is progressive operative but look at the headline it makes it seem like rubio guys are starting fight and after watching the video don think that the case the robot guy was pushing in the crowd pushing his way forward and this is rubio event rubio has right to have an event not be disrupted or have supporters displaced in the crowd by liberal activists it no different than liberals showing up at trump rallies so imo it ok to cover it you re not paying the guy to do it or coordinating with him and you mentioned you even ignored him at other rallies but how you cover it matters the headline matters and the page views it gets matters and you know that so let take wide view at all that while breitbart did nothing wrong and kelly story was supposed to be about clinton it also clear to me that there is truth here fact which is black was member of an organization democracy partners who paid people to beat up trump supporters was there an underlying motive to destroy rubio and cruz so that trump makes it to the general election where the october surprises are waiting yes that possible was black part of that plan maybe or maybe not he may personally just be opposing globalists period no matter what party they re in but you see how messy this is and how breitbart was perhaps an unknowing participant as far as me personally didn like clinton bush cruz rubio or any of them trusted trump so not losing sleep over this but word of warning as the landscape continues to shift now and years into the future be careful of how you cover stories and who is working to whom and doing what	0

the holy quran gives clear definition of adulthood and marriageable age when one has attained good measure of mental maturity as such the property of the orphans must be handed over to them when they have mature intellect to properly manage it so the quran rejects the marriage of immature girls and boys as well as entrusting them with serious responsibilities it is wrongly referred and criticised in media that hazrat ayesha was child at the time of her marriage with the prphet of islam sa hazrat ayesha ra when asked to describe the prophet character answered that his character was the quran abu dawud what prophet of islam sa did was what the quran taught what the quran taught was nothing else than what he did thus the holy prophet sa could not have married little immature child as it is against the teachings of the holy quran hadhrat ayesha ra was not little child at the time of her marriage with prophet of islam sa according to various accounts ayesha age at the time of her marriage to the prophet of islam sa was between and fifteen hundred years ago there was no system of formal education for children spanning period of decade or two as soon as children were able they would learn the trade of their father or household work from their mother they were married hazrat ayesha ra was young when she married the holy prophet of islam sa and her age was never an issue until it has recently become an issue for islamophobic writers it is important to note that any hadith which does not conform to the teachings of the quran should be rejected for the obvious reasons that the quran is the word of god and has been precisely preserved whereas the ahadith are collections of sayings of the holy prophet sa recorded long after the prophet death	0

from an american citizen of latin hispanic descent whose first language is spanish the losers under obama hillary clinton paul ryan all democrats all greedy corporations the chamber of commerce etc globalist plan are all countries societies of decent hardworking law abiding citizens who would be forced to import the impoverished of rd world nations which in many cases are nothing more then economic migrants along with their differing cultures religions laws people who refuse to assimilate and look to conquer destroy our peaceful nations with the terror and war they bring they seek to force their culture religion laws on our individual nations and have said they will kill thousands millions to achieve their goal for hundreds of years we have lived peacefully in the christians catholics jehovah witnesses jews pentecostals budhists mormons etc with each respecting the religious beliefs of others until now when obama looks to increase the population of those from countries with religious beliefs and laws who seek to destroy peaceful nations like ours they absolutely do not believe in freedom of religion nor would they assimilate and adopt the laws of other nations thus they do not belong in the or any other law abiding peaceful nations they must be turned away by all decent law abiding nations lest they destroy these nations as individual nations we also stand to lose our individual identities and history of achievements which makes us special and sets us apart from each other we the people including donald trump american citizens of all races religious backgrounds male female of the who hail from every corner of the globe are not racists nativists bigots xenophobes fascists anti-immigrant anti-hispanic white supremacists imperialists sexist islamophobic anti-semitic homophobic transphobic brown shirts nazis etc and we stand united against those who would seek to divide us along racial lines they peddle their lies while ignoring what we all know to be true the fact that the has long been an inclusive diverse peaceful nation as evidenced by the vast diversity of our citizenry we are pro-us pro-american and we are fighting for the economic survival safety of our nation citizenry we are tired of being treated as forced charity via increased taxes to pay for our own uneducated lazy able bodied citizens the if it free it for me crowd which encompasses all races not to include our vets elderly or truly disabled handicapped as well as every uneducated impoverished person their families who enter the country either legally as supposed refugees or illegally who are nothing more than economic migrants who come in search of their american dream financed by the american people taxpayers and or pose threat to our own citizens via terror or the dangerous diseases that they bring in states across the country we are seeing able bodied people of working age without dependents losing their welfare food stamps because they refuse to work the required hours week while help wanted signs continue to grow exponentially hopefully we will see more people dragged kicking and screaming into personal responsibility they are not entitled to the fruits of anothers labor the silent majority is silent no more we are sick tired of the small pockets of selfish hateful divisive protesters who seek to destroy the country from within for multitude of selfish reasons while the majority of us are united focused on that which trumps all of their little protests the safety and economic survival of the nation on these points we are absolutely united both parties in wa absolutely know this to be true but choose instead to peddle lies as distraction from their agenda which is redistribution of wealth on global level from the to other nations as they themselves their wealthy donors benefit they would destroy the country and our citizenry to increase their own power and wealth the wealthy globalist elite nevertrumpers are not altruistic they are greedy profiteers like george soros the clinton mark zuckerberg facebook bill gates microsoft eric schmidt google tim cook apple bob iger disney toys us abbott labs edison light wall street and silicon valley in general the wealthy global elites with the help of obama hillary rinos like paul ryan and democrats in general have purposely slowly been transforming the globe globalism to suit their own personal needs while attempting to convince us that it is for the benefit of all when in reality it allows them to enrich themselves even further without second thought to the damage being done to the citizens of these individual nations like pieces on chess board they have sought to move the poor uneducated and illiterate from rd world nations to those areas nations which enabled them to basically create the cheap slave labor that benefited them personally even when it included those from terrorist nations who would assault rob rape and murder those in peaceful law abiding nations case in point the mentally disabled woman and year old child who were both sexually abused raped by syrian muslims in twin falls id for the citizens of these peaceful nations one rape murder is one too many but apparently for the wealthy globalist elite there is no threshold as long as it does not affect their own families who are protected by the best armed security money can buy and the walls they have built to protect themselves the citizens of our nations are now fighting for the survival of our individual nations and the very lives of our own citizens thus the uprisings across the globe the elections of right wing leaders the demand for border control brexit etc patriotism populism nationalism is spreading across the globe much to the chagrin of the wealthy globalist elite who seek to stop donald trump from winning in november attempted to steal the election in austria their attacks on the leaders of australia who have chosen to put their own citizens first with regard to immigration after having lost control of the uk thanks to brexit the wealthy globalist elite are desperate to stop us citizens from doing the same how much have the citizens of our combined nations donated to these rd world countries via corrupt organization like the un whose chief former goldman sachs executive peter sutherland has now been outed as an advocate of george soros only to find out that it never reached those for whom it was intended instead we find that it was stolen from them by greedy corrupt world leaders to build bigger more expensive homes palaces for themselves buy bigger more expensive private airplanes take more expensive lavish vacations etc while their citizens continued to starve what of the panama papers and clinton cash what of our own divisive so called leader of the free world who decries global poverty but doesn think twice about the lavish vacations golf outings that are costing our own citizens millions billions the separate lavish vacations taken by his own family under the guise of government business obama who seeks globalism global police force as he props up divisive hateful extremist groups like black lives matter and by extension the black panthers based on proven mountain of lies while ignoring black on black crime and the exorbitant murder rate in democratically controlled cities states across the country how many were killed this past weekend in chicago baltimore ferguson philadelphia etc obama personally purposely created the incendiary divisiveness in the us then poured the gasoline lit the match himself that resulted in the deaths of so many innocent people especially police officers and now white people in general across the us don look now but there goes obama skulking off into the bushes with gas can after starting yet another fire	0

well there you go and hope to awaken you know that campaigns can get nasty and that all forgivable what you need to learn is the neoconservative movement that has since dictated what conservatism is they are the ones against trump bill kristol is the son of irving kristol there are those at national review who are adamantly opposed to trump but they will never be able to articulate why they will instead like the left does try to weave false narrative and create caricature that no where near represents the man his principles or his current policies why do think cruz is globalist socialist for starters that who runs his campaign long time ago at the end of the reagan era new sort of conservatism was borne yes many were jews but it isn jewish it is however based upon an ideology from trotsky who is jewish they believe in global order for their higher ideology of mankind this started with bush to be called bushite or bush republican is to be called neocon they are the ones who gave us the iraq war they came out of the cold war with russia determine to reorganize the world who was it that said they were culturally conservative but economically socialist oh yes go find out	0

yes think fox news has lost lot of their credibility among conservatives owner rupert murdoch is of course globalist so it is not surprising that many of fox news lackeys are anti-trump both sides of the globalist uni-party view trump as threat because he is firm nationalist and outside of their uni-party apparatus had bernie sanders not chickened out he would also have been seen as threat and he would have been given much the same type of treatment in the msm as trump has received the globalists attacked bernie wife and threatened to promote what they had on her if bernie did not endorse clinton it is telling that he quit the dems after he dropped out he had likely had his fill of dealing with the clintons and the dnc suspect he has many regrets about letting his young people down hope they turn out for donald trump but if they cannot bring themselves to do that hope that they send message to the dnc by voting for jill stein globalists come in two stripes--neoliberals the clintons and our current administration who want power distributed away from the to international bodies like the very corrupt yuck and the bushite neoconservaties who want the to remain firmly in charge of the new international order the neoliberals believe that the must be taken down peg they are the most dangerous to the continued existence of the american republic but all globalists believe that the nation-state system must be ended the left side of the uni-party neoliberals believe it must be done sooner rather than later and the right side of the uni-party believe that it must be done in more gradual way that the only difference most of them are involved in secret societies jfk who had apparently become christian not long before warned about them before his assassination	0

trump should not say word on the stage about it however he should have some of bill girlfriends seated right up front along with benghazi survivors and relatives of those killed by illegal invaders with their shirts that say remembrance project that would do it and trump can be accused of bringing up the subject he can stick to his talking points while hlllary stutters	0
both hillary and trump have never been indicted of any felony crime they both call each other liars and crooks and they are probably both right everybody knows about hlllary and bill history in the next few months we will see and hear more about trump transgressions including his past mob connections the trump university fraud case etc trump has been trashing his republican opponents and now we will see if he can take it	0

when you pose the question the mouth you are talking about hillary aren you of course she is not constitutionalist what tyrant wannabe has ever been you must be very naive there will only be candidates that can win in november hillary or trump there is not even choice the vote must be for trump however flawed he may seem to people anyone that choices to vote for hillary stays home or doesn vote for trump even if you have to hold your nose as did when voted for romney and mclame will in my opinion be traitor to america if anyone claims to to love america how can they allow hillary to pick the justices maybe or that will turn america into rd world country that is completely radical liberal can you imagine the picks for the scotus that hlllary will pick some people can not see the forest for the trees are you one that will help pick this evil woman	0

yes and her original thesis that the way to make her ideas work was to get well known black ministers involved one has hard time considering mlk as being allied with ms duped perhaps however one might note that hlllary recently got the margaret sanger award herself and hillary considers ms as an inspiration	0

for the first time in history he would win if he went independent he doesn want to but if he doesn get the nomination are we willing to walk away from the people best chance at restoring our america the media is so afraid of him they compare him to ross perot someone who had no name recognition and looks like frank perdue trump has the same recognition as the big dynasty candidates that the american people are sick of- the clintons and bushs if it is jeb and hilary he can win in landslide besides if he is number one and they don give it to him out of corruption you can take that lying down don let the left tell us how it will supposedly inevitably turn out they do that to discourage us so we back down trump is fighting and taking risk that is the only way to win big as american citizens we have to risk an independent run if we get hlllary and jeb because with them either way we lose	0

read all these angry comments about hillary only winning southern states that won matter in the general and how unfair it is guess what those are the rules that have been in place for the last years hillary played by those rules in and lost to obama who secured the nomination by winning these same southern states while she won norhern blue states and did she whine how unfair it was and urge her supporters to stay home or vote for mccain no she came out strongly for barack obama and he won if bernie wins the nomination under the rules in place will support him but ask the bernie supporters who are threatening to vote trump if the rules are not changed midstream and all the southern votes mostly african-american are discounted to give it to bernie what happens if the hillary supporters do the same thing you really couldn object now could you bernie is not democrat he never worked to help build the very party who nomination he now seeks it only because of the hard work of tens of thousands of demoracts over these past decades and yes that includes hllary clnton that there is even an organized party in the first place powerful enough to take on the gop if we all acted like he did the past years and basically went off on our own no matter how good our message was the gop would reign supreme just some things to think about	0
